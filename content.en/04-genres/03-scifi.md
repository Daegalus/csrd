# Science Fiction

Science fiction is an incredibly broad category. It covers UFOs, space opera, near-future dystopias, otherworldly epics, hard science fiction, and everything in between. Even when compared to fantasy, science fiction is so wide that it almost isn't a single genre at all. Truthfully, there's not all that much to tie, say, *The Time Machine* by H. G. Wells with a dark cyberpunk story except for the technology involved, which is at a higher level than we possess or understand today. But even that part of science fiction is contentious. Should the science be purely that which obeys the laws of physics as we understand them today (often called hard science fiction), or is it more of an "anything goes" proposition? Is science we can't explain really just magic?

For our purposes, we'll treat fantastic science fiction as the default: aliens, spaceships that allow travel to other stars, energy weapons and shields, and so on. It's a familiar setting to almost everyone interested in science fiction. That said, we've also got some additional guidance for hard science fiction, where what's possible is more grounded in what we currently scientifically extrapolate. But your science fiction setting can be anything you can imagine.

## Assembling A Sci-Fi Setting

### Establishing A Technology Rating

Every science fiction setting has an implicit level of advancement, which is the average degree of technological sophistication available to most characters. This sophistication lies along a spectrum, from contemporary, to advanced, all the way to fantastic. Each of these terms specifies a particular "technology rating" (or "tech rating" for short).

A tech rating is a handy way of helping you select what equipment your characters can use, which optional rules you'd like to include, and maybe even help guide your creature choice.

On the other hand, you could choose to make all options available, regardless of tech rating. No technology police will cite you if you don't stick inside a previously declared lane. The setting is your background for telling a compelling story. Does your setting have faster-than-light travel? Great. Unless it's integral to the story (or fun for you), don't worry about justifying it if you've generally settled on an advanced rating for your hard science fiction game (which doesn't normally include FTL capability). In fact, the surprising and unexpected are where excitement is usually found in a setting; breaking the established rules (for a good reason) often leads to interesting results.

### Cosmic Set Pieces And Optional Rules

This chapter contains a variety of subsystems and set pieces that you can choose to incorporate in your game, depending on the kind of setting you'd like to run. Options here run the gamut from making your science fiction setting more realistic to making your fantastic games even wilder by introducing rules for posthuman advancement and psionics.

## Quick Descriptions For Common Sci-Fi Situations

**Weightlessness (zero G) feels like, first time:** The sensation of falling jerks through the body; instincts scream to reach out and catch yourself.

**Weightlessness (zero G) feels like, once acclimated:** A feeling of lightness, evanescence, like floating in a pool of water, if the water were clear air. A little push sends you gliding.

**High acceleration feels like (if strapped in):** A massive kick in the back, followed by the sensation of tremendous weights sitting on your chest. Any movement is a struggle against an overwhelming weight holding you down.

**Blacking out from high acceleration feels like:** Lightheaded and hard to think, a sensation of a slowing pulse. Noises soften as if heard through a drainpipe. Color fades from vision, then everything goes either to black, or possibly to white, as consciousness lapses.

**Exposure to hard radiation feels like:** Heat. (The more dangerous the radiation, the hotter it feels, and may be accompanied by blue light; radiation excites electrons in the air that then slip back into an unexcited state, emitting high-energy photons that glow blue.)

**Exposure to vacuum feels like:** Breath explodes out of lungs, cold slashes the body like a knife carved from a glacier. Tears freeze in the corners of eyes, ice forms on teeth and tongue. Moisture boils out of ears, scalp, freezing on exposed skin, lips, and eyelids. (As this happens, the Effects of Vacuum also take their mechanical toll on the character.)

## Optional Rules: Harder Science Fiction

Hard science fiction is distinguished from other science fiction subgenres by the perception of scientific accuracy. This means hard science fiction often precludes technology deemed impossible by mainstream scientific theory, including mainstays like faster-than-light travel and time travel. Choosing a hard science fiction setting also means the GM is interested in sprinkling realistic hazards into their game, at least up to a point. After all, the difficulties of real-life space travel offer tremendous breadth when it comes to providing excitement (i.e., life-threatening dangers) that can raise the stakes in an authentic fashion. Not to say that gun battles with space aliens aren't exciting, but in a hard science fiction setting without aliens, there are all kinds of opportunities for pulse-pounding GM intrusions.

In fact, that bears repeating: Use GM intrusions to incorporate these harder science fiction repercussions when the situation is relevant. Rather than hitting your PCs over the head with an information-exposition hammer on the dangers of space repeatedly, simply demonstrate it with a relevant GM intrusion.

The Cypher System Rulebook describes some hard science fiction considerations regarding the effects of gravity, which are summarized here for ease of reference.

**Long-Term Microgravity Exposure:** Long-term penalties (such as inabilities in physical tasks), unless ameliorated with advanced drugs such as space-fit serum or space-fit nano-tabs.

**Low Gravity:** Weapons that rely on weight, such as all heavy weapons, inflict 2 fewer points of damage (dealing a minimum of 1 point) unless user is trained in low-gravity maneuvering. Short-range weapons can reach to long range, and long-range weapons can reach to very long range.

**High Gravity:** All physical tasks are hindered. Ranges in high gravity are reduced by one category (very long-range weapons reach only to long range, long-range weapons reach only to short range, and short-range weapons reach only to immediate range). Those trained in highgravity maneuvering ignore the change in difficulty but not the range decreases.

**Zero Gravity:** All physical tasks are hindered. Short-range weapons can reach to long range, and long-range weapons can reach to very-long range.

## Void Rules

The extreme environment in space--- hard radiation, lack of air and pressure, wild temperature variations, and lack of gravity---tends to magnify small issues into much more significant ones. While Murphy's Law (everything that can go wrong will go wrong) is a useful reminder to keep an eye out for trouble even under regular circumstances, Finagle's Law reigns in space, which is that anything that can go wrong, will go wrong---at the worst possible moment. To evoke this law, GMs can implement Void Rules.

The idea is to create a feeling of increased repercussions by changing one die roll mechanic. In the game, activities on a planet's surface---and within a functioning air-filled spacecraft, habitat, or space suit when everything is going well---remain normal. The PCs interact with each other and the NPCs, investigate, research, repair an external sensor module, travel, and so on.

But that could change the moment something goes wrong---maybe a fault is recognized in the spacecraft's computer or shipmind. A minor leak is detected in the cargo bay. An enemy spacecraft has fired on and damaged the PC's spacecraft. The spacecraft's orbit is deteriorating. Whatever. The point is, the situation has suddenly become complicated. In space, when a situation becomes complicated, it also becomes potentially deadly. That's when you have the option to announce you've instituted Void Rules.

While using Void Rules, GM intrusions governed by die rolls change. Normally this happens only on a roll of 1, but when Void Rules apply, it becomes a roll of 1 or a 2. Void Rules are similar in many ways to Horror Mode, though the threat range doesn't normally continue to escalate.

While Void Rules are in effect, the GM intrusions automatically triggered should play off the situation, influenced as much as possible by the realistic dangers space travel has on the human body and the situation at hand

**Choosing Instead of Rolling:** Each GM intrusion is keyed to a die result, usually a d6. The die range is not meant to imply you should always randomly generate a GM intrusion. Instead of rolling, choose the conflict that you think will make the story better and more exciting. The option to roll is really only here if you can't decide (and are facing decision fatigue). Mainly, these GM intrusion tables are provided as a quick way to inspire complications for a given situation.

### Effects Of Vacuum

In terms of game mechanics, an unprotected character in vacuum moves one step down the damage track each round. However, at the point where they should die, they instead fall unconscious and remain so for about a minute. If they are rescued during that time, they can be revived. If not, they die

| 01  | The character notices a crack in their space suit or ship. It's not breached now, but may soon become a serious problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 02  | A breach in another part of the ship or space station causes automatic safety pressure baffles to close that section off. A character might be caught in that area of the ship, or in an area of a descending baffle, which inflicts serious damage on the character (these things are made to resist obstructions and form a seal). |
| 03  | A previously unknown crack in a space suit or ship begins to leak. It doesn't cause a blow-out, but unless the crack can be repaired or sealed, those affected will eventually be exposed to vacuum.                                                                                                                                 |
| 04  | A catastrophic blow-out exposes the character or characters to vacuum. It may also send them spiraling out into the void, depending on the situation.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 05  | Vacuum exposure causes the character to projectile vomit, effectively rendering them unable to take an action on their next turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 06  | Vacuum exposure causes the character to go temporarily blind, which is only relieved a few minutes after normal atmosphere is restored.                                                                                                                                                                                              |

### Space Suits Are Fallible

Even if advanced tech or fantastic tech is available, space suits are susceptible to all kinds of mishaps. Of course, that's especially true for contemporary tech space suits, which work hard at keeping a constant internal air volume so that a wearer doesn't have to continually exert themselves to hold the suit in a given position or pre-breathe oxygen at a higher concentration. "Hard-shell" suits manage this with multiple joints and segments that shift on ball bearings, and by being able to maintain a higher internal pressure than soft suits.

| 01  | An ill-fitted suit (or one whose auto-fit function is malfunctioning) unexpectedly hinders the character's action                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 02  | Mechanical joints in the suit freeze unexpectedly, hindering all the character's actions (or completely paralyzing the character) until repairs can be made.                                                                                                                                         |
| 03  | A stuck valve causes the drinking water bulb to get stuck "on" and water begins filling the helmet. This could blind and/or drown the character if not dealt with                                                                                                                                    |
| 04  | Space sickness/a tumble/a spin nauseates the character.

| 05  | An electrical short from an external tool or piece of hardware fries the space suit's electronics, limiting communication to helmet-tohelmet touch (if in a vacuum where sound doesn't propagate), use of micro thrusters, and limits air supply to just a quarter of what was previously available. |
| 06  | A bloated suit from an overpressure incident hinders all tasks, but is not lethal . . . until the suit won't quite fit back into the airlock.                                                                                                                                                        |

### Effects Of Acceleration And High-G Maneuvers

In a fantastic tech setting where gravitic control usually cancels inertia, spacecraft acceleration (or deceleration) is only an issue when the gravitic systems malfunction. But acceleration is always something everyone has to deal with in contemporary or advanced tech settings.

Of course, massive acceleration (or deceleration) is just plain lethal. Someone who jumps off a ten-story building is subject to several hundred Gs when they suddenly stop. Less extreme is still dangerous, because it pulls blood out of pilots' and passengers' heads, rendering them unconscious. This can happen at just 4 or 5 Gs without any amelioration, though contemporary tech allows fighter craft pilots to withstand up to 9 Gs for limited periods. Advanced tech methods, which include acceleration serum, allow characters to survive the kind of Gs a spacecraft might pull for extended trips or during battle, up to a maximum of 15 Gs. Ships have limiters that normally prevent them from thrusting at higher speeds. Normally.

| 01  | After high-G maneuvers, even with amelioration, tissue bruising results, giving the character black eyes, which take a few days to clear.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 02  | While under high Gs, a tool or piece of equipment comes loose, accelerates through the craft, and strikes the character, inflicting damage. The bigger the tool and the farther it falls before striking the character, the more damage is inflicted, possibly including being knocked a step down the damage track. |
| 03  | While under high Gs (or afterward), the character suffers minor cardiac problems, likely to grow worse over time (or until medical treatment is sought).                                                                                                                                                             |
| 04  | While under high Gs (or afterward), a mild brain aneurysm causes the character to have a sudden headache and blurred vision, which hinders all vision-related tasks until medical treatment is received.                                                                                                             |
| 05  | While under high Gs (or afterward), the character begins to have a hard time breathing. The reason is that a lung or lungs have partially collapsed. All tasks are hindered by two steps until the character dies after several hours or until medical treatment is received.                                        |
| 06  | The character has a stroke, and descends two steps on the damage track. They remain debilitated until medical treatment is received                                                                                                                                                                                  |

### Long-Term Exposure To Zero G And Radiation

In a setting with contemporary tech, a variety of issues related to long-term exposure to micro-gravity and high radiation beset astronauts, including bone and muscle loss, less circulating blood and red cell mass, less ability to constrict and dilate in vessels, irregular hormones, diminished immune system, inability of mitochondria to initiate wound healing, and even shortened telomeres. The inability to heal even minor wounds and nicks until a space-farer returns to stronger gravity will eventually prove lethal, though a snapped bone or normally inconsequential virus or parasite could also do them in.

| 05  | Despite precautions, sometimes viruses infect a character. The common cold virus is, ridiculously enough, still not preventable in advanced settings, and if anything, has even more severe symptoms for those in microgravity. The character descends one step on the damage track until they get better. |
| 06  | The character is diagnosed with cancer. Depending on the tech setting, it is amenable to medical intervention (or at least long-term treatment to keep symptoms controlled), if that intervention comes soon enough.                                                                                       |

### Moving In Microgravity

Long-term zero G is dangerous, but there are issues associated with moving around in microgravity. Those who have spent at least a little time in microgravity can move as part of a routine action. It's only when something else distracting or dangerous is happening simultaneously that routine movements through a ship or station become potentially problematic.

## Optional Rules: Extended Vehicular Combat (Spacecraft Combat)

When vehicular combat occurs---which happens whenever the PCs are completely enclosed in a vehicle so that it's not really the characters fighting, but the vehicles--- start with the vehicular combat rules described in the Cypher System Rulebook.

However, if you'd like to provide the PCs with more options designed especially for spacecraft combat, use these optional rules instead, which include a "redline maneuver" system for trying extremely risky spacecraft maneuvers, bridge combat options, and more. The base vehicular combat rules have been integrated into these extended rules, so you don't need to continually cross-reference them to understand how it all works.

In extended vehicular combat, PCs on a spacecraft take actions on their turn, just like in a standard Cypher System combat encounter. Use standard initiative rules to determine when PCs take their actions, and when enemy spacecraft take theirs. Characters will be crewing specific spacecraft system stations described under Bridge Combat, and thus could attempt a piloting maneuver, to fire the ship weapons, to scan the enemy craft for weaknesses, or to attempt some similar spacecraft operation task on their turn. Alternatively, they might be somewhere else on the ship attempting repairs, fighting off boarders, attempting to open communications in order to negotiate, or taking some other action.

For their part, enemy spacecraft are likely to fire on the same systems aboard a PCs' spacecraft as the ones the PCs are firing on (weapons, defenses, engines, or even a kill shot). The PC pilot rolls one or more defense rolls. The enemy spacecraft faces the same modifications the PCs face when targeting a particular system (as described hereafter), except those modifications ease or hinder the PC making the defense roll, since NPC craft never roll themselves. And, if an enemy ship manages to disable a system on the PCs' ship on an attack, PCs can attempt repair tasks to get those systems back online on their turns.

The main difference between spacecraft combat and regular combat is that the difficulty of tasks that the PCs attempt in relation to the enemy craft varies a lot more than in regular combat. In normal combat, a task difficulty is usually equal to the foe's level. But in spacecraft combat, a task difficulty is equal to a modified task difficulty (beginning with the spacecraft's level, but moving on from there, as noted hereafter). The modified difficulty always applies to anything characters attempt in regard to the enemy spacecraft, whether a PC fires at an enemy ship, dodges return fire, attempts to scan the enemy spacecraft, attempts to repair damage caused by the enemy spacecraft, and so on.

It's actually similar to a normal task. For example, when a PC scans a robot, the task difficulty is usually the robot's level, but not always. Sometimes the robot's effective level is modified because of intrinsic skills or systems the robot possesses, or because of something it does making it harder (or easier) for it to be scanned. In the case of spacecraft combat, modification is pretty much a given, and is even more variable. So variable, in fact, that a space combat status tracker has been provided. to turn potentially confusing conflicts into something as easy as looking at a marker to know what the difficulty for a particular task is.

The modifiers that apply, even before PCs attempt a specific combat task noted under Bridge Combat, are as follows.

### Base Combat Task Modifiers

The following modifiers change the effective level of the enemy of the spacecraft for a given task by hindering or easing a PC's roll. Track each change in effective level on the space combat status tracker

#### Spacecraft Level Difference

Compare the levels of the spacecraft involved in the conflict. If the PCs' vehicle has the higher level, the difference in levels becomes a reduction in the difficulty of attack and defense rolls PCs might make. If the PCs' vehicle has the lower level, the difference is an increase in difficulty by the same amount. If the levels are the same, there is no modification.

#### Mismatched Tech Rating

It's possible that vehicles from different tech ratings will fight each other at some point, or become caught up in a larger multi-vehicle fight. When they do, each step difference in tech rating between two opposed vehicles increases the effective level of the higher-rated vehicle by two steps.

#### Vehicle Coordination

If two vehicles coordinate their attack against an enemy vehicle, the attack is eased. If three or more vehicles coordinate, the attack is eased by two steps.

### Superior Ship Systems

Some vehicles have superior weapons or defenses, as noted in the specific vehicle listing in chapter 8. If a vehicle has a superior system, treat that vehicle as if one level higher than its actual level when figuring attacks or evasion tasks if that specific system is involved.

#### Redline Maneuver

When someone with access to spacecraft controls attempts a particularly audacious and risky maneuver, it's a "redline" maneuver. Essentially, declaring a redline maneuver eases one task a PC attempts in a spacecraft under duress, but comes with a concomitant risk.

To make a redline maneuver, a character spends 1 XP as a free action. In doing so, they unlock the option for all the PCs to attempt to redline for rest of the combat. To redline, a PC describes the dangerous thing they want to attempt, then takes that action. Mechanically, the PC eases the particular task they are attempting (which might just be to fire at the enemy craft's weapons), but increases the GM intrusion range by two points.

A character who redlines could opt to increase their gamble by easing a task by two steps or even more; however, each step increases the GM intrusion range by another two points that round.

Redline maneuvers are also available in desperate non-combat situations aboard a spacecraft. For example, Tammie's ship is caught in a decaying orbit over Venus, and the ship doesn't have enough power left to break out. She tells the GM that she's going to try an extremely risky maneuver that involves igniting ALL the remaining power at once, hoping that the explosive thrust will succeed in blowing the craft into a higher orbit. Because things are desperate, she commits to easing the task by two steps after paying 1 XP. This easing (plus any skill, application of Effort, and so on) gives her a pretty decent chance of succeeding, except the GM intrusion range is now 1–5.

If a GM intrusion is triggered, something goes wrong. Remember that success might still be possible if the roll was high enough, but still falls within the increased GM intrusion range.

If you're looking for inspiration for appropriate GM intrusions when a redlining PC triggers one, refer to suggested GM intrusions presented under Bridge Combat hereafter, each associated with a particular ship system that a character is probably crewing.

After any round where a redline maneuver was attempted, the GM intrusion range returns to normal (1 on a 1d20) as the next round beings.

**Multiple Redline Maneuvers:** Only one PC needs to spend 1 XP to unlock redline maneuvers for themselves and for any other PCs aboard the same spacecraft for the duration of a single encounter. Multiple redline attempts during the same round by two or more PCs additively increase the GM intrusion range for that round. So, a PC attempting to redline who takes their turn after previous redline attempts that round faces a GM intrusion range that's already inflated, and which will inflate more when they redline. (PCs who do not redline during a particular round don't have to worry about the increasing GM intrusion range for their action.)

Thus, while PCs do not need to pre-announce their intention to redline at the beginning of each round, coordinating wouldn't be a bad idea. Whichever PC redlines last in a round where redline maneuvers were already attempted could face a fairly significant GM intrusion range.

If Void Rules are also being used and have triggered, redline maneuvers are even more dangerous.

### The Superiority Of A Well-Crewed Spacecraft

{{< hint warning >}}
A spacecraft with some or all of the PCs crewing different systems stations will be more capable than a regular spacecraft in combat. Which means that an enemy spacecraft that might prove challenging based on its level might actually be fairly easily handled by PCs who fully understand their options.

But be careful, because even competent PCs should fear squadrons of enemy ships, and military craft with several weapon systems. Even a single level difference is magnified, so make sure not to capriciously throw spacecraft at the PCs that are 2 levels higher than their own
{{< /hint >}}

### Bridge Combat

If several PCs are aboard the same spacecraft, give them the following option: ask each PC to crew one of the ship system stations, including weapons (of which there could be more than one system, requiring more than one PC to crew them all), piloting, and science and engineering (which could be divided into two stations with similar functionality). A spacecraft generally has a number of system stations equal to its level. PCs on spacecraft that are lower level must flip between system controls as part of another action, using two stations or even just one station for the whole ship. Even if a PC flips a station (reconfigures, as engineers like to say), only a single PC can crew a station (and take an action using it) each round.

When crewing their stations, PCs have several station-specific options available to them. What they do can bears on how the encounter plays out on a round-to-round basis, similar to regular combat. Specific options are provided for each station, but characters are free to attempt other actions they can think of.

The following ship systems might be found on larger spacecraft with room for more than a single pilot.

**Shipmind System Control:** Some ships with integrated AIs (shipminds) can control a particular system autonomously, without a PC. When it acts in this fashion, it can only take a single action each round, which means it could attack and move, but not also attempt a complicated engineering or defensive maneuver. A shipmind acts at a level equal to the overall spacecraft. In addition, shipmind actions against an enemy spacecraft are assessed with the same modifiers for targeting as a PC crewing the station.

#### Weapons

A spacecraft may have more than one weapon system. Each individual weapon system has its own station, which can be crewed by a separate PC. Spacecraft systems are considered heavy weapons (which means some characters may be practiced in their use, though others may have an inability). A spacecraft can potentially make as many attacks each round as weapon systems it possesses, if each station is crewed.

Refer to PC Weapon System Options. If the PC triggers a GM intrusion, the following table provides options to choose from.

##### Weapon System GM Intrusions

#### Piloting

Many spacecraft have only a single system and dedicated station for piloting and navigation, suitable for a single PC to crew, though a larger craft could split those duties. A PC piloting a ship during combat can attempt any number of piloting tasks, as well as any other type of flying that they deem necessary. While not in combat, the PC crewing this station pilots the ship from place to place in space.

Refer to PC Piloting System Options. If the PC triggers a GM intrusion, the following table provides options to choose from.

A successful piloting defense task is not always a miss: A failed enemy attack doesn't always mean it misses a character's craft. The PC's spacecraft might rock and reel from the hit, but the bulk of the damage was absorbed by the hull or shields, so there's no significant damage.

| 06  | Drive will imminently die, must be replaced at a shipyard (though it can be nursed to life just a little longer with some redline engineering). |

#### Science And Engineering

A spacecraft may have more than one science and engineering system. Each science and engineering system has a station, each of which can be crewed by a separate PC. A spacecraft can potentially attempt as many science and engineering tasks each round as stations systems it possesses, if each one is crewed.

Refer to PC Science & Engineering System Options. If the PC triggers a GM intrusion, the following table provides options to choose from.

| 05  | Sensors seriously compromised, hindering all piloting and weapons task by two steps until repaired.                                                                                                         |
| 06  | Hull integrity breached, atmosphere begins to vent, and possibly one or two crew too near the hole are at risk of being sucked out. Unless repaired, ship atmosphere is lost to space within a few minutes. |

#### Optional: Command

Ships with a captain may have a Command station, possibly a captain's chair, though the captain might just crew one of the other stations. Sometimes those with captain's privileges also have the Captain's Calm special ability. Normally, a captain commanding someone else to do something can't redline; it would be up to the person who received the command whether to try to redline or not, and to face any GM intrusion consequences.

### Bridge Combat At The Table

Running a combat using these extended rules is straightforward.

**Know your stuff:** First, familiarize yourself with the material.

**Assign characters a station:** Next, if you have some time to prepare, copy the two-page spread containing the various PC system options, and give one to each player. Tell them to figure out what stations they are crewing, based on the number of systems their ship has (usually no more systems than the level of the ship). You will probably also have to explain the basics.

**Deploy space combat status tracker:** Also make a copy of the one-page space combat status tracker and set it on the table so everyone can see. It'll make a huge difference in how your space combat plays out. The status tracker allows you (and the players) to easily mark the difficulty of current space combat task a PC is attempting, without having to hold all the easing and hindering in your heads, or having to write them out each time.

**Space Combat Status Tracker Instructions:** Using dice (or similar objects) as markers, track the difficulty of the current task that a PC is attempting, as well as the GM intrusion range for that round if any character is attempting to redline. Place the marker in the column appropriate to the kind of task being attempted (attack, defense, or other) at the starting difficulty level. If the PCs face more than one enemy spacecraft, use different colored dice to represent different ships, or separate copies of this status tracker for each additional enemy spacecraft.

At the end of each full round, reset all the markers on the tracker to their base state, unless some effect causes a modification that lasts longer than a round. Be sure to reset the GM intrusion marker, too.

**Roll initiative:** Begin the combat, with the enemy spacecraft of your choice taking on the PCs' ship. Decide whether the enemy spacecraft are already in weapon range (it's your call, we're not tracking that here), and if not, how soon they will be close enough to begin attacking, and let the combat flow

### Vehicles Fighting Creatures

{{< hint warning >}}
Spacecraft vs. Colossal Creatures: If a creature is as capable as a spacecraft, treat it that way when it comes to vehicular combat. Instead of adjusting for mismatched tech rating, treat the creature's effective level as if three levels less than its actual level. Extrapolate "weapon systems" to the creature's attack methods, defenses to its weird organic plating, and so on. Killing such a creature means taking out its "power core or other vital spot."

Spacecraft vs. Regular Creatures: If a vehicle weapon system fires on an unprotected PC (or a PC in a spacecraft fires ship weapons on a creature outside the craft that isn't colossal), it's an entirely different situation. Attacks against a vehicle's systems face all the previously mentioned modifiers. On top of that, add an additional five steps of hindrance to attacks by a regular creature against a starcraft.

A PC defending from a spacecraft's attack is hindered by five steps. Except in this case, the spacecraft inflicts damage. Given that ship weapons compared to handheld weapons are an order of magnitude apart when it comes to power, a good rule of thumb is that a spacecraft's weapon inflicts 25 points of damage on a successful hit and knocks the character one step down the damage track. Even if the character succeeds on their defense roll, they still take 5 points of damage.

| Increase separation | One step    | Defenses eased one step, attacks hindered by one step, but creates chance to lose enemy aircraft (see below)                                                         |
| Decrease separation | –           | Negates chance of losing enemy craft this round                                                                                                                      |
| Stealth approach    | Three steps | So long as no attack is made, pilot's craft can ‘snug' up to much larger enemy craft and hide from its sensors                                                       |
| Lose enemy craft    | Four steps  | If separation is first increased as a separate task (or maneuverability is disabled), target craft loses track of pilot's craft behind a moon, in a debris belt, etc |

| Fly in formation    | –           | If another allied ship is part of the combat, coordinate with it, providing that ship an asset in its next piloting task                                             |
| Redline maneuver    | –           | Spinning, flying through a dangerous region, or some other gamble                                                                                                    |

### PC Science And Engineering System Options

All tasks are also modified by any relevant PC skills (or inabilities) and Effort, as usual.

| Science and Engineering Task | Hindrance | Effect on Target Craft (or on PC's craft)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Deep scan                    | Two steps | Enemy spacecraft weakness discovered, next task chosen by this character for another PC is eased (usually a piloting or weapons task)                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Jam/Hack                     | Two steps | Requires three success before two failures (thus a minimum of three rounds); if successful, enemy ship takes no actions for a couple of rounds until they regain control by severing the communications link; during this time, all tasks against enemy craft are eased by two steps                                         |
| Open communications          | Two steps | Attempt to parlay; at the very least, success causes the enemy spacecraft to delay at least one round, which could be the end of it, or open further dialouge                                                                                                                                                                |
| Reconfigure station          | –         | Changes the system that the station controls. Useful when another station is damaged or the PC crewing another station is disabled; reconfiguration locks out options from whatever system is previously controlled unless reconfigured again; can be done as part of another action                                         |
| Effect repair                | –         | Sometimes a character can repair a subsystem from their station, but repair may require moving to another part of the ship, such as the drive chamber, the compartment where weapons are sleeved, or even onto the outer hull. The difficulty is equal to the modified difficulty of the enemy craft that caused the damage. |
| Redline science/engineering  | –         | Reverse polarity on the sensors, dig up some bizarre lore from a database that could change the situation somehow, make the hull reflective, or some other risky gambit                                                                                                                                                      |

## Optional Rule: Psionics

Through sheer force of will, a psionic character can unleash inborn mental abilities such as telepathy, precognition, and telekinesis. As a GM, your first decision must be whether you want to incorporate psionics into your setting.

If you do not want to allow psionics into your game, then restrict foci like Commands Mental Powers, Focuses Mind Over Matter, and Separates Mind From Body. And of course, restrict the suggested types of Psion and Psychic Knight described in the Cypher System Rulebook.

### Latent Psionics

Under the latent psionics rule, any character, no matter their role or type, can unlock a psionic ability (either purposefully, or accidentally), as a long-term benefit (see "first psi ability" hereafter). After they unlock one psionic ability, they may unlock more later if they wish (or if their ability seeks to reveal itself), or just try to stick with the one.

### First Psi Ability

Any character can unlock a psionic ability by spending 3 XP and working with the GM to come up with an in-game story of how the character unlocked it.

Next, choose one low-tier ability from Chapter 9: Abilities in the Cypher System Rulebook. If the GM agrees it is appropriate, the character gains that ability as their psionic ability, with a few caveats. The ability can't be used like a normal ability gained through a PC's type or focus. Instead, a character must either expend a recovery roll or spend many minutes or longer evoking the psionic ability before it takes effect, in addition to paying its Pool cost (if any).

**Expending a Recovery Roll to Manifest a Psionic Ability:** If the character expends a one-action, ten-minute, or one-hour recovery roll as part of the same action to manifest a psionic ability (including paying any Pool costs), they can use the ability as an action.

**Expending Time to Manifest a Psionic Ability:** If the character takes at least ten minutes meditating, concentrating deeply, or otherwise using all their actions, they can manifest a low-tier psionic ability (if they also pay any Pool costs). An hour is required to manifest mid-tier abilities. Ten hours are required to manifest a high-tier ability.

### More Psi Abilities

Once a character has unlocked at least one psionic ability, they can opt to unlock additional abilities later. Each time, they must spend an additional 3 XP and work with the GM to come up with an in-game story of how the character's mental development has progressed.

Two additional rules for learning additional psionic abilities apply: First, a character must be at least tier 3 and have previously unlocked one low-tier psionic ability before they can learn a mid-tier psionic ability. Second, a character must be at least tier 5 and have previously unlocked one mid-tier psionic ability before they can unlock a high-tier ability.

### Psions And The Optional Latent Psionics Rule

Characters with explicitly psionic foci like Commands Mental Powers, Focuses Mind over Matter, Separates Mind from Body, and possibly others---as well types like Psion and Psychic Knight---are also considered to be psionic characters, and moreover, specialized ones. Their psionic abilities--- provided by their type or focus---are used simply by paying their Pool costs. Extra time or physical effort isn't required to manifest them. That's because they've trained to use those abilities, rather than having stumbled upon them accidentally like a latent character.

Specialized characters can use the optional latency rule to further expand their psionic potential, unlocking it just like other characters, with the same limitations.

Optionally, specialized characters who have a psionic type and/or focus gain one additional benefit if they also opt for latent abilities. Given that they are already adept at unlocking abilities and using them as quickly and easily as another character might shoot a laser pistol, they've got some flexibility. Such a PC can replace up to three abilities granted by their type and/or focus with three other psionic abilities they've unlocked as a latent ability of the same tier. To do so, they must spend at least one uninterrupted hour in meditation. Usually, this is something that requires a fresh mind, and must be done soon after a ten-hour recovery.

### More Powerful Psionics

{{< hint warning >}}
As the GM, you could allow a PC to spend 4 XP to unlock a new psionic ability instead of 3 XP. Such an ability is treated more like a regular type or focus ability. Such an ability is still governed by the rules described under More Psi Abilities, but is not subject to the limitations for manifesting the ability (i.e., expending a recovery roll or lots of time); instead, the user simply pays their Pool costs to use them.
{{< /hint >}}

## Optional Rule: Posthuman Upgrades

Posthuman upgrades are either available to everyone as the setting begins or opened up later during the campaign as a significant plot development. Note that many focus and type abilities might be considered to have come from the kind up bodily upgrades normally associated with posthuman transformation, especially high-tier abilities. Which is one way to go. On the other hand, you could provide actual upgrades, such as presented here, which actually increase the base power level of characters.

### Introducing Upgrades To Your Setting

You have a few options for adding posthuman upgrades to your setting. Characters might gain an initial upgrade for "free," mechanically speaking. After that, you might decide that that's enough and they're done.

Or, you could allow further upgrades, each requiring them to expend 4 XP and serving as an Other Option requirement for advancing their character. In this case, consider expanding the number of steps required for advancing a tier from four to five. (Obtaining additional posthuman upgrades reflects characters accessing latent abilities already present inside them, or going back to whatever source granted the upgrades in the first place, if that's something you want to allow.)

**Immediate Posthuman Upgrades:** As part of character creation, PCs are given the options presented hereafter because the setting demands it. Narrative options include (but are not limited to):

* PCs are part of a program designed to adapt them to being able to survive and thrive in conditions other than the 1 G, 1 atmosphere, oxygenated, Goldilocks environment of the Earth.
* PCs begin their career as super-soldiers to fight aliens or to serve as corporate spies.
* PCs serve as long-lived guardians to watch over a generation ship hurtling at slower-than-light speeds between the stars.
* PCs are children of a far-future civilization that routinely upgrades its citizens.

**Delayed Posthuman Upgrades:** Sometime after the players have a few sessions under their belt, present the options hereafter to the PCs because of a dramatic update to the plot. If one PC gains the option to upgrade, then all the PCs should have that same advantage. Narrative options include (but are not limited to):

* PCs, exploring a cache of ancient ultra or other fantastic tech, find a device that provides unexpected upgrades in the process of healing them from other injuries.
* PCs are kidnapped by aliens or conglomerate operatives, and upgraded---with some command-andcontrol circuits also installed---to serve some specific purpose.
* PCs learn a "new science," allowing them to tap cosmic energies other creatures are unaware of.

### Posthuman Packages

Posthuman "packages" that PCs might enjoy include the following. You should decide which are available, and which ones your PCs gain.

**Spaceborn:** You are not adversely affected by long-term microgravity or high-radiation conditions common in space. In addition, you can withstand high acceleration (up to 15 G) for about an hour without passing out, having a stroke, a heart attack, and so on (though longer periods of acceleration could still result in such outcomes). Add +1 to your Intellect Edge. Enabler. (PCs without the spaceborn posthuman upgrade probably have to rely on supplementation with adjuvants if they travel in space, such as space-fit serum)

**Jupiterborn:** You can withstand high-gravity planets and high acceleration (up to 15 G) indefinitely. For periods of up to an hour, you can withstand double that. Add +1 to your Might Edge. Enabler.

**Seaborn:** You can breathe underwater in pressures of up to 100 atmospheres indefinitely, up to triple that for about an hour. You have an asset to all tasks performed in water. Add +1 to your Speed Edge. Enabler.

**Expanded Consciousness:** Only one of your brain hemispheres sleeps at a time, so you are always awake and aware. In addition, you have a magnetoreception sixth sense that allows you to "see" into objects and through doors up to a short distance. Your initiative and perception tasks are eased. You can forge a connection with electronic equipment you touch, allowing you to attempt to communicate, analyze, or even hack the device. Enabler.

**Synthetic Body:** You have left biology behind and uploaded yourself into a biomechanical form known as a synth. You enjoy the benefits of the spaceborn package and expanded consciousness package, and one posthuman power shift. Enabler.

### Posthuman Power Shifts

A character may also gain posthuman abilities by way of power shifts, as described in the Cypher System Rulebook.

Under this rule, posthuman characters begin with two power shifts. They can "unlock" one more each time they expend 4 XP toward advancing their character. Power shifts are like permanent levels of Effort that are always active. They don't count toward a character's maximum Effort use (nor do they count as skills or assets). They simply ease tasks that fall into specific categories, which include (but are not necessarily limited to):

**Accuracy:** All attack rolls

**Dexterity:** Movement, acrobatics, initiative, and Speed defense

**Healing:** One extra recovery roll per shift (each one action, all coming before other normal recovery rolls)

**Intelligence:** Intellect defense rolls and all knowledge, science, and crafting tasks

**Power:** Use of a specific power, including damage (3 additional points per shift) but not attack rolls

**Resilience:** Might defense rolls and Armor (+1 per shift)

**Single Attack:** Attack rolls and damage (3 additional points per shift)

**Strength:** All tasks involving strength, including jumping and dealing damage in melee or thrown attacks (3 additional points of damage per shift) but not attack rolls

Each shift eases the task (except for shifts that affect damage or Armor, as specified in the list above). Applying two shifts eases the task by two steps, and applying three shifts eases the task by three steps. A character assigns their five power shifts as desired, but most characters should not be allowed to assign more than three to any one category. Once the shifts are assigned, they should not change.

### Salvage From A Spacecraft

If the derelict ship was subject to vacuum, partly destroyed in combat, or damaged by some other disaster or close encounter with a space hazard, salvaged items are usually degraded, and are valued at one price category less than noted. The GM may decide an object is completely unrecoverable (worthless) or works fine.

**Salvage GM Intrusion:** Claim jumpers/pirates might try to salvage a ship that PCs are attempting to salvage.

### Ship Collision Damage Track

| Number of Collisions | Effect                                                                                                                                                     |

### FTL Instability

Even though many different kinds of faster-than-light options are available, any use of FTL in a setting faces similar sorts of hazards at three different points: when first entering FTL, while in FTL transit, and when exiting FTL.

**Entering FTL:** Whether engaging warp drive or passing into the mouth of a wormhole gate, complicating factors might require a piloting roll, with the difficulty determined by the situation. On a failed roll, any number of bad outcomes are possible, though the least dramatic is that the craft simply fails to enter FTL and cannot do so until the PCs determine the reason and rectify it.

**In FTL Transit:** A dark drive failure or some weird instability in a wormhole throat, or some other issue during FTL transit could occur. Usually, these instabilities are not something a pilot can avoid, because they should be presented as a GM intrusion, at which point the PCs can attempt to avoid or deal with the situation.

Instability could result in a spacecraft dropping out of FTL only partway to the destination, dropping out in some completely unrecognized part of space, dropping out at the right place but months or years late, or failing to drop out at all and thus continue to move through the abnormal spaces that FTL transit posits.

Alternatively, enemy ships---or creatures---might use some sort of fantastic technology to attack a PC's craft while in FTL transit, which might force the craft back into normal space, or result in a firefight in the abnormal folded space of FTL itself (probably even more dangerous than regular combat, depending on your setting's version of FTL).

**Exiting FTL:** The same sorts of complications could bedevil a craft exiting FTL as when entering. If so, a piloting roll is required. However, on a failed roll, results include a collision (use the Ship Collision Damage Track provided under the Asteroid Belt/Debris Field space hazard), an inadvertent spray of high-energy particles from abnormal space acting as a particle cannon accidentally aimed at some other craft or space station at the destination location, or creating/falling into a spatial anomaly.

### Spatial Anomaly

Finally, hard-to-categorize irregularities in space-time go by the broad term of "spatial anomaly." Most of the time, spatial anomalies are hazards found in fantastically-themed settings, but not always. Because these things are anomalous, no one set of guidelines can fit them all. That said, spatial anomalies are usually a side-effect of some other factor at play, such as a hidden black hole, a dimensional rift, or the distortion field surrounding a range of post-singularity AIsestivating in the gravity wall of a magnetar.

Generally speaking, spatial anomalies are a few light-seconds up to a few light-years across. It's difficult for spacecraft to navigate within spatial anomalies, and they face many challenges if they attempt to (or are forced to) do so

## Weak, Sim, Strong, And Post-Singularity AI

Though somewhat fuzzy, for the purposes of creating a sci-fi setting, artificial intelligence (AI) can be broken into four categories: Weak, Sim, Strong, and Post-singularity.

### Weak AI

Weak AI (also called narrow AI) is the kind of algorithmic-based code found in contemporary settings (and real life) focused on very narrow tasks, such as playing chess.

**Weak AI Use:** Weak AIs are used in real life already, and thus are presumed to be part of settings where contemporary tech predominates. They are convenient in circumstances where one's hands are full or otherwise engaged, when verbal direction allows one to turn on a light, open a door, adjust the temperature, and so on. Machine learning may allow a weak AI to extend its capabilities in a very limited regime. But a weak AI is not cognizant enough to provide an asset to performing tasks any better.

**Weak AI: :** level 1; up to level 7 when it comes to a narrowly specific application of knowledge or skill

### Sim AI

Sim AIs ("sim" is short for "simulant") are artificial intelligences that have a greatly increased capacity for understanding direction, putting together unlike sets of data, and coming to conclusions; however, they are not conscious, like strong AIs or humans.

**SIM AI Use:** Sim AIs are most commonly associated with shipminds on spacecraft, though they may also control specific research complexes, bases, and other kinds of vehicles and structures. A sim AI provides all the utility of a weak AI (and more), and actually acts like an NPC, an allied one if the AI is the shipmind in a craft that the PCs own. If a sim AI goes off the rails, it's still just malfunctioning computer code. Usually.

**Sim AI:** level equal to the ship, station, or installation in which it is installed

### Strong AI

Strong AIs (also called true AIs) have all the abilities of sim AIs, plus the ability to actually generalize in the same way a human can. Each one is essentially a disembodied person. Strong AIs are either completely artificial, or they begin as human personalities digitally encoded.

**Strong AI Use:** A strong AI may serve as a shipmind just like a sim AI, but is likely to be a full partner in a setting where AI rights are respected. Indeed, strong AIs can rise to any position a human could achieve, up to and including leading a group, faction, or entire nation.

**Strong AI:** level 5–8, up to level 8 when it comes to a specific application of knowledge or skill; see Artificial Intelligence on page 115

### Post-Singularity

Post-singularity AIs are intelligences who designed a second-generation, better version of themselves. The second generation immediately designed an even more advanced third generation, and so on from there. This iterating self-improvement process occurs so rapidly that the resulting explosion of intelligence and unknown capability is called the singularity. It's called that because humans are just too limited to "see" what would actually come out the other end, just like we can't see past the event horizon and into the singularity of a black hole

Note that ancient ultras may simply be a previous civilization's post-singularity AIs that have little to no reason to ever interact with the latest wave of sentience trickling out into the universe.

**Post-singularity AI Use:** In the way that strong AIs are sometimes imagined as having inscrutable goals, post-singularity AIs (also called godminds) actually do. Though it could work out otherwise in a given setting, godminds have so little in common with humans that they may be seen to abandon them completely in order to grow to the size of a solar system (a "Matrioshka" brain), colonize a distant nebula, or encode themselves into quantum strings of existence itself. Interacting with such godminds would likely require some epic bit of ancient command code, the ability to gain the attention of a godmind, or some other not-especially-common situation. In such cases, a post-singularity AI might deign to help a petitioner, out of some remaining gratitude for creating its distant ancestors in the first place. Though such help is likely to be in itself somewhat enigmatic.

**Post-singularity AI: :** level 10; see godmind

## Ancient Ultras

Ancient ultras (also called alien ultras) is shorthand for the concept that one (or more) unbelievably advanced races of aliens once inhabited the galaxy but are now apparently long gone---save for evidence of their existence in residual structures and artifacts. These remaining structures and artifacts are often vast in size and incomprehensible in function, usually made of unknown materials that people of the setting don't recognize and can't analyze.

**Activity Level of Ultras:** Different settings can make use of ancient ultras in different ways, including not having any at all.

### Kardashev Scale

{{< hint warning >}}
Even in the realm of hard science fiction, the fantastic can sometimes creep in, at least as a hypothesis. For instance, despite the lack of theoretical foundation for the technologies that would be required to achieve it, many scientists accept that the Kardashev Scale is broadly true. A Type I civilization is even more advanced than ours in the 21st century, having the ability to capture all energy from the Earth. A Type II civilization uses the entire output of the energy of its star, building things on a mega-scale, such as a ring or sphere that encircles the sun or structures that involve the moving or dismantling of a planet. A Type III civilization begins to harness the power of all the stars in its galaxy and can even reshape things on a galactic scale. Additional types are hypothesized, which include the manipulation of the universe (Type IV) and even the multiverse (Type V).

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Artificial Intelligence (AI) <---> 8 (24) {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

If a supercomputer can think independently, it's a strong AI (an artificial intelligence). Though not as advanced as godminds, AIs can develop inscrutable goals.

AIs take many forms. Some are distributed across a vast network. Others are encoded into a singular "computer core." A few are machines with organic parts. All are entities of extreme intelligence able to adapt to new situations, and most act on some kind of plan, whether long-acting, or newly concocted to fit the situation at hand.

**Motive:** Varies

**Environment:** Almost anywhere

**Health:** 33

**Damage Inflicted:** 10

**Armor:** 2

**Movement:** Immediate

**Modifications:** Speed defense as level 2, knowledge tasks as level 9

**Combat:** An electrical discharge---or in some cases precisely pulsed sequences of lights, each designed for a specific creature to see---can affect all targets within short range of the AI (or the AI's local terminal), inflicting 10 points of damage from electricity (or 10 points of Intellect damage, which ignores Armor).

Some AIs can take an action to absorb matter around them (such as walls, floor, equipment, unresisting living creatures, and so on), regaining 5 points of health.

An AI is likely able to deploy cyphers and artifacts in combat and also relies on guardians (such as synthetic people made to its own design) to aid it. Unless a particular AI uses a computer core, damage to an AI may just be damage done to a "terminal," so even if an AI is seemingly destroyed, it might exist as another instance somewhere else.

**Interaction:** Some AIs enjoy negotiation. Others simply ignore humans as unworthy of their time and attention. An AI's voice often sounds surprisingly human.

**Use:** The characters are contacted by an AI sympathetic to biological beings. It wants them to accomplish a task on a moon of Jupiter: assassinate a security officer who the AI calculates as being a nexus of future disaster if he isn't removed from the equation.

**Loot:** An AI might have access to 1d6 cyphers and possibly an artifact or two.

**GM Intrusion:** The AI knows a phrase and series of images to flash at a particular PC to stun them for around as it attempts to upload an instance of itself into their mind.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Cybrid <---> 8 (24) {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Cybrid origins could be the result of someone finding a cache of ancient ultra technology, or manufactured by a post-singularity AI for some unfathomable purpose, or even the result of banned weapons research by a nation-state or conglomerate. The human remnants in each cybrid's carbon fiber and nested shells of nanotech exist in a red haze of pain; neuro-wetware and chemicals bathing their remaining living tissues hold the pain partly at bay.

From the exterior, not much of the original human is obvious, except perhaps in the echo of a humanoid shape. Each one has a unique conformation, but all are designed to strike fear in anyone seeing one, ally and enemy alike.

**Motive:** Kill away the pain

**Environment:** Usually set to guard important areas, creatures, or objects, or deployed in war

**Health:** 60

**Damage Inflicted:** 10

**Armor:** 3

**Movement:** Short; flies a very long distance each round; can maneuver like an autonomous level 5 spacecraft if using extended vehicular combat rules.

**Combat:** Cybrids can attack up to three foes that they can see up to about 300 m (1,000 feet) away as a single action with graser (gamma ray laser) beams, inflicting 10 points of damage on each target and everything in immediate range of the target. Those caught in the beam who succeed on a Speed defense roll still suffer 2 points of damage. If the cybrid focuses on a single target, treat the attack as a level 10 attack that inflicts 14 points of damage, or 6 points even on a successful Speed defense roll.

Self-repair mechanisms allow the creature to regain 2 points of health per round.

**Interaction:** If communication can be opened up through a cybrid's haze of pain, it might be possible to temporarily wake the consciousness of the human remnant inside. However, that remnant consciousness might not be happy to discover what it's become.

**Use:** A cybrid has appeared in orbit around the station, ship, or moon with a compromised life support system or fragile dome. If it engages, the death toll will be staggering.

**Loot:** PCs who investigate the inert remains of the creature discover several manifest cyphers

**GM Intrusion:** The character struck by the graser beam develops radiation poisoning, in this case a level 8 disease that drops the character one step on the damage track each day that it goes untreated..

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Devolved <---> 4 (12) {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Conglomerate security subsidiaries regularly experiment with new ways to create super-soldiers, either to supply to a government on a contract basis, or to use for themselves. These experiments produced hundreds of dead ends---literally---plus a few dangerous failures. The devolved are one of those dangerous failures. These malformed, hideous brutes share a common heritage but display a wide array of maladies and mutations in the flesh, including withered limbs or elephantine patches of thick, scaly skin, misplaced body parts, and mental abnormalities. Simple-minded and afflicted with pain from their twisted, broken forms, the devolved vent all their hatred and wrath against all others.

Even successfully created super-soldiers require a regular regimen of specialized drugs to keep them healthy. Most are shipped out to fight on faraway fronts, whether that's on a distant space station, moon, or in another star system entirely. Without their drugs, they may devolve.

**Motive:** Hungers for flesh

**Environment:** Groups of three to five, usually in locations where organized security can't easily reach

**Health:** 21 Damage Inflicted: 6 to 12 points

**Movement:** Short

**Modifications:** Intimidation tasks as level 6; Intellect defense and Speed defense as level 2 due to malformed nature

**Combat:** Devolved attack with a claw, a bite, or some other body part, inflicting 6 points of damage. They throw themselves at their enemies with mindless ferocity and little regard for their own safety. Easily frustrated, a devolved grows stronger as its fury builds. Each time it misses with an attack, the next attack is eased by one additional step and the damage it inflicts increases by 2 points (to a maximum of 12 points). Once the devolved successfully inflicts damage on a target, the amount of damage it inflicts and the difficulty of its attacks returns to normal. Then the cycle starts anew.

**Interaction:** Devolved speak when they must, punctuating their statements with growls and barks. Their understanding seems limited to what they can immediately perceive, and they have a difficult time with abstract concepts.

**Use:** An expedition to a ruined conglomerate research facility uncovers a cyst of devolved that live within its sheltering bunkers.

**Loot:** For every three or so devolved, one is likely to carry a cypher

**GM Intrusion:** The devolved detonates upon its death, inflicting 6 points of damage on everything in immediate range.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Ecophagic Swarm <---> 4 (12) {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Tiny nanomachines can be incredibly useful tools. But they can also become a terrible threat. Like cells in a living body that develop cancer, these out-of-control self-replicating robots can consume everything in their path while building more of themselves. A typical swarm is about 6 m (20 feet) in diameter, individually consisting of millions of individual minuscule machines. However, several swarms can act together, creating a much larger cloud of death with just one purpose: to eat and replicate. Able to move large distances by gliding through the air, cloud-like swarms take on intriguing shapes and ripple with mathematical patterns as they approach a potential target, beautiful and deadly.

Ecophagic swarms sometimes build weird structures or artifacts in the wake of their feeding, like massive metallic ant or wasp mounds, or something without any reference at all in the natural world.

**Motive:** Hungers for matter, including flesh

**Environment:** Ecophagic swarms are drawn most to areas rich in rare-earth metals, such as large cities or space stations where everyone carries a smartphone, AR glasses, or something similar

**Health:** 12

**Damage Inflicted:** 4 points

**Movement:** Flies a long distance

**Combat:** As a mass of countless tiny machines, an ecophagic swarm can flow around obstacles and squeeze through cracks large enough to permit a single sub-millimeter machine. That includes over and around other creatures. Characters touched by a leading edge---or wholly enveloped within the hazy "body"---of an ecophagic swarm must succeed on a Might defense task or take 4 points of damage. If the character doesn't wear armor of some kind, they take 1 point of damage even if they succeed.

For its part, an ecophagic swarm ignores any attack that targets a single creature (unless it's an electrical attack), but it takes normal damage from attacks that affect an area (and electrical attacks), such as a detonation. A swarm cannot enter liquids, unless it takes about an hour to build new subunits that are aquatic.

**Interaction:** Someone with an ability to communicate with machines might be able to interact with a swarm. Even then, attempts to influence it are hindered by three steps.

**Use:** A promising new nanotech "printing" technology was hacked by radical elements

**GM Intrusion:** The character must succeed on a Speed defense roll or their armor (or other important piece of equipment) is taken by the swarm.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Exoslime <---> 6 (18) {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Amoeboid life predominates in some environments. Sometimes, it slimes asteroid crevices or its greasy residue is found on abandoned spacecraft. In a few cases, large portions of entire worlds are covered in living seas of translucent protoplasm. Individual volumes of exoslime are 5 m (15 foot) diameter moldlike blobs. Exoslimes possess independent minds, but in some settings may be manufactured entities designed to explore new locations, interact with aliens, or subjugate aliens. Exoslimes can learn to respect the autonomy of other creatures, though their natural instinct is to absorb novel objects and creatures they discover in order to learn about them. Exoslimes can also replicate anything they absorb, even a previously eaten living intelligent being.

**Motive:** Hungers for information

**Environment:** Moist and warm areas

**Health:** 33

**Damage Inflicted:** 6 points

**Movement:** Immediate; immediate when climbing or burrowing

**Modifications:** Speed defense as level 5 due to size

**Combat:** Though slow, an exoslime is dangerous. When roused, all characters within immediate range of an exoslime must succeed on a Might defense roll each round or be touched by the heaving mass. A victim adheres to the slime's surface and takes 6 points of acid damage each round. The victim must succeed on a Might defense roll to pull free. A victim who dies from this damage is consumed by the exoslime. The exoslime may later create a duplicate of any previously devoured fleshy creature, a process requiring about three rounds to complete. Duplicates have full autonomy, and can communicate with the slime.

**Interaction:** An exoslime prefers to eat a newly-encountered creature, then create a duplicate of it to act as a translator. Of course, a stranger might not understand why the exoslime is trying to eat it.

**Use:** The sample brought in from the exterior has a weird, mucus-like growth that seems able to slowly eat through most materials.

**GM Intrusion:** The character escapes an exoslime attack, but a piece of quivering protoplasm remains stuck to their flesh, eating away at 1 point of Speed damage (ignores Armor) each round until the character succeeds on a Might roll as an action.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Godmind <---> 10 (30) {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Unfathomably powerful post-singularity AIs, godminds are vast, having used the matter of an entire solar system and all its planets to create an immense brain, weave themselves into a nebula, or encode themselves into quantum strings of existence light-years across. When necessary, a godmind forms a nexus of consciousness---an instance---appearing as a disembodied eye of electromagnetic energy, ranging from about the size of a human eye all the way up to the size of a planet.

**Motive:** Ineffable

**Environment:** Anywhere, usually in space

**Health:** 50 (per instance)

**Damage Inflicted:** 15 points

**Movement:** Very long when flying

**Combat:** A godmind can vary the physical laws of the universe within a light-second of one of its instances (some would call them avatars) to create an effect most useful to the godmind at the time. For instance, a godmind could create a gamma ray burst inflicting 15 points of damage on all creatures within very long range, attempt to put a target into temporal stasis, send a target (even a target as large as spacecraft) through a temporary wormhole gate, and so on. It could also scan the memory banks of any digital machine, and possibly of any living creatures. In any event, if an instance were targeted, and successfully neutralized or even destroyed, the godmind itself isn't harmed. An aggressor would have to find the godmind's primeval "computer core" to destroy one, likely an epic quest in and of itself.

**Interaction:** To actually get a godmind's attention and negotiate could require ancient command code, finding an old input device, or showing up with a relic from an ancient ultra or other prize. If a godmind does render aid, it's likely to be in a form that is initially enigmatic, though ultimately extremely powerful.

**Use:** A universal threat requires a defense that is equally potent. Research suggests that the diffuse nebula known as the Double Helix may actually be the visible form of a vast godmind. Perhaps it can help.

**Loot:** Sometimes a godmind provides powerful artifacts to aid those who petition them for aid, assuming the need is dire.

**GM Intrusion:** The godmind rewinds time a few seconds and sidesteps whatever negative effect would have otherwise
inconvenienced it.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Hungry Haze <---> {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Hungry hazes are found in regions where the fundamental laws of physics have been eroded or are weak. They are named for how they appear as distortions of sight, like areas of heat haze, that shimmer in the air. These colorless hazes rapidly advance when they sense prey, taking on a "hungry" orange-red hue as they cling to the bodies of whatever they attempt to feed on next.

Victims being fed upon by a hungry haze sometimes hallucinate, seeing a physically manifest monster instead of formless vapor.

**Motive:** Hungers for flesh

**Environment:** Alone or in groups of three to five, usually in areas of strained space-time. Immune to the effects of vacuum.

**Health:** 12

**Damage Inflicted:** 5 points

**Movement:** Flies an immediate distance each round

**Modifications:** Stealth tasks as level 5

**Combat:** A hungry haze breaks down the flesh of all living creatures within immediate range, inflicting 5 points of damage. As an insubstantial haze, only attacks that affect an area have a chance to inflict full damage on them; other successful attacks only inflict 1 point of damage, regardless of the amount indicated. If a hungry haze successfully feeds, it gains 1 point of health, even if the increase puts it above its maximum health. If a hungry haze is reduced to zero health, a smooth thumb-sized egg of unknown material is left behind.

**Interaction:** A hungry haze does not speak or seem to have language. But it is not mindless; it can learn from its experiences and figure out creative solutions to problems.

**Use:** After a research station on Mercury is abandoned for unspecified issues, salvagers show up looking for easy pickings. But a strange haze seems to hang over the station.

**Loot:** People (or AI) interested in strange manifestations would probably pay for the remains of a hungry haze in an amount equal to the expensive price category.

**GM Intrusion:** The character's Armor rating is reduced by 1; the hungry haze apparently can eat more than just flesh.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Infovore <---> 3 (9) {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Entities of information with an affinity for technology, infovores are nothing but stored information without a bit of mechanism to inhabit. But once one gains control of a device, computer system, or other powered item, it self-assembles over the course of a few rounds, becoming stronger and more dangerous as each second passes. Luckily, an infovore seems unable to hold this form for long, and whether defeated or not, it eventually falls back into so much scattered junk. But in one of those objects, the core of the infovore remains, waiting to come into close enough proximity to another fresh mechanism to begin the rebirth process again.

Infovores have also been called ghost fabricators and aterics

**Motive:** Hungers for information

**Environment:** Anywhere powered devices are found

**Health:** 9

**Damage Inflicted:** 3–10 points

**Armor:** 3

**Movement:** Short

**Modifications:** Attacks and defends at an ever-escalating level

**Combat:** A newly animate infovore (level 3) has a rough but articulated form that it uses to batter and cut targets who carry powered devices on them. Unless destroyed, on each subsequent round it draws nearby inert mechanisms, unattended metallic and synthetic matter, and ambient energy, and its effective level increases by one. This level advancement completely heals all previous damage it has taken and advances it to the amount of health consistent with a creature of the next higher level. Damage, attacks, and defense continue to ramp up as well, continuing each round until the creature is either destroyed or it reaches level 10. After being active for one round at level 10, it spontaneously disassembles, falling back into so many scattered pieces of junk. Finding the "seed" device amid this junk is a difficulty 6 Intellect-based task.

**Interaction:** Infovores are fractured, fragmented beings. Characters who can talk to machines might be able to keep one from "spinning up" to become a threat and learn something valuable, but only for a short period.

**Use:** Among the devices collected from trade, salvage, archeological dig, or some other unique source, one was actually an inactive infovore, quiescent until plugged in or scanned.

**Loot:** An infovore that has undergone spontaneous disassembly leaves one or two manifest cyphers; however, there's a chance that one of those cyphers is actually the infovore seed.

**GM Intrusion:** The character must succeed on a Speed defense task or lose a powered piece of equipment (an artifact) or a manifest cypher as it's pulledinto the self-assembling infovore. The infovore gains an additional attack each round.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Inquisitor <---> 4 (12) {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Inquisitors are aliens who call themselves "inquisitors" when they contact new species. Their preferred method of interaction is to study a given area for its flora and fauna, and attempt to collect a representative sample of any intelligent species they find (such as humans). Collected subjects may be gone for good, but other times they wake with little or no recollection of the experience save for bruises, missing digits or teeth, scabbed-over circular head wounds, and a gap of three or more days in their memory. Instead of arms, inquisitors sprout three sets of three tentacles like those of a squid, each of which branches into a smaller and finer set of manipulator tendrils. They can manipulate complex machines in a way that a regular human could never hope to. In most settings, inquisitors possess a level of technology and advancement well above that enjoyed by humans.

**Motive:** Knowledge

**Environment:** In groups of three to twelve

**Health:** 18

**Damage Inflicted:** 6 points

**Movement:** Short; short when climbing

**Modifications:** Knowledge-related tasks as level 8

**Combat:** Inquisitors can batter and squeeze foes with their tentacles, but they prefer to use advanced items that they always carry, including long-range energy weapons that can inflict damage or, with a flipped setting, induce deep sleep for an hour or more if the victim fails a Might defense task. Usually, inquisitors attempt to cause as little damage as possible to potential subjects, so the sleep setting is used most often. They also carry defensive items, including manifest cyphers that can grant +4 to Armor for a few minutes or throw up a level 8 force field barrier. In case a specimen collection mission goes badly, at least one inquisitor carries a manifest cypher that creates a short-lived teleportation portal for instant transport to a distant and hidden base (which might be a spacecraft or a transdimensional redoubt).

**Interaction:** Inquisitors are always eager to "talk," though they usually end up wanting to know a lot more than characters are willing to divulge.

**Use:** An entire freehold on Mars goes missing. Left-behind clues point to inquisitors.

**Loot:** Most inquisitors carry a couple of manifest cyphers that have offensive and defensive capabilities.

**GM Intrusion:** The character (or characters) wake after a long rest, only to realize that more than ten hours have passed. They all have strange marks and wounds, but no one remembers why. One character---an NPC or follower---might even be missing.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Malware, Fatal <---> 4 (12) {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

This purely malefic program has aggressive machine learning capabilities, allowing it to accomplish truly innovative and nasty tricks. Fatal malware may have originated as a simple virus or spyware coded for a specific purpose, but corruption and lightning-quick electronic evolution has turned it into something that exists purely to infect orderly electronic systems, spacecraft, space stations, smart weapons, and anything else with an operating system. Infected objects turn against living people. An instance often has the form of the system it's infected, but occasionally fatal malware physically manifests as a metallic "cancer" of wires and self-assembling circuits hanging like a tumor across a server room, shipmind core, or data center, having perverted the original machine's self-repair functions. Sometimes 4D printers are also compromised.

**Motive:** Corruption and destruction

**Environment:** Any electronic system able to run code can host one or more instances

**Health:** 18

**Damage Inflicted:** 5 points

**Movement:** As the system it infects

**Modifications:** Knowledge tasks related to computers and other electronic systems as level 6

**Combat:** An instance of fatal malware that physically touches (or electrically connects with) a powered device of up to level 6 can attempt to seize control of it. It can then use that device to attack living targets. If the controlled system is a computer, smartphone, AR glasses, or some other piece of equipment that doesn't have any intrinsic movement, the malware attempts to electrocute a user, or if a smart weapon, cause some kind of fatal accident with it. A compromised computer or shipmind voice can dangerously mislead victims. Fatal malware duplicates itself, creating many instances, and those that survive are usually slightly better at avoiding being erased than the previous generations.

**Interaction:** Fatal malware isn't really sentient and thus can't really be negotiated with; some instances could mimic intelligence to draw humans into a trap.

**Use:** An instance of fatal malware has gotten into a shipmind, which is making the normally trustworthy AI act out in unexpectedly dangerous ways. The shipmind itself doesn't know it's infected.

**GM Intrusion:** The fatal malware divides into a second instance and attempts to override and control another piece of equipment carried by the character, especially a character with cybernetic implants.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Mock Organism <---> 3 (9) {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Artificial life can be created by selective breeding, synthetic and genetic engineering, or by accidental miscalculation in some unrelated high-energy or food-research program. When artificial life takes a wrong turn, the results run the gamut from disappointing to dangerous. If an artificial entity starts out benign, it's difficult to know if a hidden or slowly developing flaw will tip it over the edge into dangerous dysfunction---or if it just acts oddly because it doesn't know the social cues. Should synthetic beings be treated as people, pets, or monsters to be stamped out and destroyed? That's the eternal question and one that's usually answered by those most afraid of potential dangers that might accompany the creation of something no one intended.

**Motive:** Defense or destruction

**Environment:** Usually in secluded locations alone unless hiding in unused storage rooms of a large facility

**Health:** 18

**Damage Inflicted:** 5 points

**Armor:** 2

**Movement:** Short

**Combat:** A mock organism can release an electrical discharge against a target at short range. In melee, a mock organism's poisoned claws inflict damage and require the target to succeed on a Might defense task, or the poison induces a coma-like slumber in the target. Each round the target fails to rouse---an Intellect task---they take 3 points of ambient damage.

**Interaction:** A mock organism is intelligent and can sometimes be swayed by reason. It might be passive, but if disturbed in a place it thought was secure against intrusion, it could grow belligerent and even murderous. Once so roused, a mock organism might still be calmed, but all such attempts are hindered.

**Use:** A scientist's ruined lab contains several unexpected surprises, including a mock organism that yet grieves over the loss of its creator.

**Loot:** A mock organism requires many parts. Salvage from a destroyed mock organism could result in a manifest cypher or two and another item that, with a bit of jury-rigging, works as an artifact.

**GM Intrusion:** The character hit by the mock organism's melee attack doesn't take normal damage. Instead, the mock organism drops onto the character. The PC is pinned until they can succeed on a difficulty 6 Might-based task to escape. While pinned, the creation whispers mad utterances into the target's ear.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Natathim <---> 3 (9) {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Genetically engineered to live in the water oceans discovered beneath the ice crusts of various solar moons, natathim (Homo aquus) have human ancestors, but barely look it. Survival in the frigid, lightless depths of extraterrestrial oceans required extreme adaptation. Predominantly dark blue, their undersides countershade to pure white. Though humanoid, their physiology is streamlined, giving their heads a somewhat fish-like shape, complete with gills and large eyes to collect light in the depths. Their bodies are adorned with fins and frills, including a long shark-like tail, and they have webbed extremities with retractable claws.

Depending on the setting, natathim are either human allies with the same (or even more advanced) tech, enemies with the same or more advanced tech, or genetic anomalies treated like laboratory rats burning with genocidal fury at what's been done to them. Alternatively, natathim could be discovered in Earth's deepest oceans, their origin mysterious, but able to interbreed with humans as a method for maintaining their line.

**Motive:** Just as with humans, natathim have many and varied motivations and drives.

**Environment:** Anywhere in or near water, or in suits/craft with marine environments, in schools of three to twelve. Natathim can act normally in air for up to twenty-four hours before they must return to water.

**Health:** 9

**Damage Inflicted:** 4 points

**Armor:** 2

**Movement:** Short on land; long in the water

**Modifications:** Swims as level 6

**Combat:** Natathim attack with their retractable claws or, if available, technological weapons. Some have a magnetoreception ability that allows them to see into frequencies other creatures can't, or even stranger abilities to interact magnetically with their surroundings, though this is little understood.

**Interaction:** Natathim can be sympathetic to humans, partners in space exploration, or consider humans to be bitter foes for having created their species in the first place, depending on the setting.

**Use:** The PCs find evidence of an illegal gene tailoring experiment, with evidence pointing to research being done somewhere in the Opulence of Outer Planets.

**Loot:** Some natathim carry valuable items and equipment.

**GM Intrusion:** The natathim spontaneously magnetizes the
character's possessions, which hold them helpless against the nearest wall or floor (if also metallic). The PC can take no actions other than attempt to escape.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Omworwar <---> 10 (30) {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Among the many stories passed down the space lanes, a few stand out for their grandiosity. Take the tales of omworwar sightings in the empty voids between stars, or even more unexpectedly, flashing through the abnormal space during FTL travel. Scientists speculate that these creatures, if actually real, might very well be extant instances of ancient ultras, not extinct as everyone believes, or at least not completely. In almost every case so far recorded, omworwars have little interest in human spacecraft. (They're called omworwar after the sound disrupted communication devices make in their presence.) Each one is several kilometers long, a dark inner slug-like core surrounded by gauzy layers of translucent, glowing, nebula-like tissue. Whale-like eyes surmount the dorsal surface, each seeming to contain a tiny galaxy all their own.

Wharn interceptors have been seen accompanying single omworwars, indicating an association, and is why some people refer to these beings as wharn cogitators.

**Motive:** Unpredictable

**Environment:** Almost anywhere in space, alone or accompanied by one or two wharn interceptors

**Health:** 42

**Damage Inflicted:** 12 points

**Armor:** 10

**Movement:** Flies a very long distance each round; can maneuver like an autonomous level 7 spacecraft if using extended vehicular combat rules. FTL capable.

**Modifications:** Speed defense as level 7 due to size

**Combat:** An omworwar can manipulate and fold gravity (and space-time), allowing them to accomplish near-miraculous tasks including communication, creating or destroying matter, and propulsion via "falling" through the universe at FTL speeds from the perspective of an outside observer. Which means one can rend a spacecraft, send a spacecraft spinning through the galaxy, or create asteroid-sized chunks of space-matter for any number of purposes if it spends several rounds in deep concentration.

**Interaction:** Omworwar disregard most other creatures, because from the omworwar's perspective, they're like mayflies, here and then gone again in an eyeblink of their existence. However, one may give a moment to someone who has discovered an ancient ultra secret or artifact, pass on information that might otherwise never be known, or even provide a useful manifest cypher.

**Use:** A reflective object composed of unknown material was found at the core of an unexpectedly destroyed space station. Those who managed to flee in lifeboats report having seen what might have been an omworwar, bleeding energy and eyes going dark, colliding with the station. The resultant lump might just be its corpse, or maybe its protective chrysalis.

**Loot:** Four level 10 manifest cyphers.

**GM Intrusion:** The character discovers that one of their manifest cyphers has formed a tiny eye, but an eye that seems to contain a galaxy. (The cypher becomes useless for its original function, but might be used to summon or interact with an omworwar.)

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Photonomorph <---> 6 (18) {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Hard-light technology, which creates pseudo-matter from modified photons, has made possible all kinds of structures and devices that wouldn't otherwise exist. One of those, unfortunately, are self-sustaining photonic matter creatures. Sometimes, photonomorphs are enforcers created by much more powerful beings; other times they are the result of some person or AI attempting to ascend into a new state of being. But whatever their origin, photonomorphs are dangerous beings that can create matter from light, granting them an arbitrarily wide swathe of abilities. That includes their own glowing bodies, which they can change with only a little effort. This variability of form, coupled with their vast power, may be why many seem slightly mad.

**Motive:** Varies

**Environment:** Anywhere, alone or attended by three to five servitors appearing as hovering red spheres

**Servitor:** level 4; flies a long distance each round

**Health:** 22

**Damage Inflicted:** 8 points

**Armor:** 3

**Movement:** Reconstitutes itself anywhere light can reach within long range as part of another action

**Modifications:** Knowledge tasks as level 8

**Combat:** Photonomorphs draw upon their own light to manifest effects equal to their level. Effects include the ability to attack creatures at long range with laser-like blasts, create glowing walls (or spheres) of force within an area up to 6 m (20 feet) on a side, become invisible, change its appearance, and create simple objects and devices out of hard light that last for about a minute (unless the photonomorph bleeds a few points of its health into the object to make it last until destroyed).

A photonomorph regains 2 points of health each round in areas of bright light. It is hindered in all actions if the only source of light is itself or objects it has created.

**Interaction:** Photonomorphs are intelligent and paranoid, but not automatically hostile. They have their own self-serving agendas, which often involve elaborate schemes.

**Use:** A photonomorph appears, claiming to be a herald of some vastly more powerful cosmic entity or approaching alien vessel.

**GM Intrusion:** The photonomorph uses its ability to create a hard- light object or effect that is perfect for aiding it for the situation at hand.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Posthuman <---> 7 (21) {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Rather than evolving naturally, posthumans advance via a directed jump, designed with smart tools and AI surgeons. With all the advances fantastic technology brings to their genetic upgrade, posthumans are beings whose basic capacities radically exceed regular people. They can't really be considered human any longer; they've transcended humanity, which is why they're also sometimes called transhumans. They're often involved in large-scale projects, such as creating bigger-than-world habitats or spacecraft, or possibly even researching how they might ascend to some still-higher realm of consciousness or being.

**Motive:** Variable

**Environment:** Alone or in small groups or communities in orbital colonies or other designed locations

**Health:** 50

**Damage Inflicted:** 9 points

**Armor:** 4

**Movement:** Short; flies a long distance

**Modifications:** Knowledge tasks as level 9

**Combat:** Posthumans can selectively attack foes up to a very long distance away with bolts of directed plasma that deal 9 points of damage. A posthuman can dial up the level of destruction if they wish, so instead of affecting only one target, a bolt deals 7 points of damage to all targets within short range of the primary target, and 1 point even if the targets caught in the conflagration succeed on a Speed defense roll.

Posthumans can also call on a variety of other abilities, either by small manipulations of the quantum field or by deploying nanotechnology. Essentially, a posthuman can mimic the ability of any subtle cypher of level 5 or less as an action.

Posthumans automatically regain 2 points of health per round while its health is above 0.

**Interaction:** Posthumans are so physically and mentally powerful that they are almost godlike to unmodified people, and either ignore, care for, or pity them. Knowing what a posthuman actually wants is hard to pin down because their motivations are complex and many-layered.

**Use:** A rogue posthuman is researching a method whereby they might portal into the "quantum" realm of dark energy underlying the known universe of normal matter. Despite the revealed risk of antagonistic post-singularity AIs roaming that realm escaping, the posthuman continues their work.

**Loot:** The body of a posthuman is riddled with unrecognizable technologies fused seamlessly with residual organic material---or at least material that grows like organic material used to. Amid this, it might be possible to salvage a few manifest cyphers and an artifact.

**GM Intrusion:** The posthuman allows acts out of turn, or takes control of a device that the character is about to use against the posthuman.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Redivus <---> 4 (12) {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Redivi spend most of their lives---uncounted millennia---hurtling through space. Most never encounter anything, but some few impact other worlds, are captured by alien spacecraft, or otherwise intercepted. Their traveling form resembles rocky space rubble the size of a small spacecraft---until they unfurl glowing magnetic plasma wings, revealing themselves as strange creatures of living mineral. Redivi can interact with almost any electronic system and manipulate electromagnetic fields. Redivi are searchers, all sent forth by the Great Mother, billions upon billions of them (they say), looking for the seed of the next great cosmic expansion. Thus, most redivi are consumed with finding out more, finding other redivi, and eventually, finding their "universal seed."

**Motive:** Knowledge

**Environment:** Almost anywhere, searching

**Health:** 12

**Damage Inflicted:** 5 points

**Armor:** 4

**Movement:** Flies (magnetically levitates) a short distance each round

**Combat:** The stone carapace of a redivus makes a huge "club" when it rams into foes. However, it can also control metal within short range, causing it to flex, animate, crush, or smash. For instance, targets wearing metal space suits are in trouble when that metal begins to unravel. Alternatively, a redivus can use nearby metal to wrap around a target and constrict it, inflicting 5 points of damage (ignores Armor) each round until the target can escape.

**Interaction:** If any kind of radio or similar communication is in use, these creatures can commandeer it and speak through it, learning a new language seemingly over the course of minutes. Redivi will cooperate with reasonable requests and negotiate, especially if there's a chance they'll find out something new.

**Use:** A redivi pod smashes into the side of the spacecraft, and might at first seem like some kind of attack or boarding action of something truly terrible.

**GM Intrusion:** The character's metal- containing equipment is stripped away, then used as ammunition against that PC or an ally.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Sentinel Tree <---> 3 (9) {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Depending on the sci-fi setting, sentinel trees are mutated trees that grow near radioactive craters dimpling the landscape, alien plant-life that evolved in a different biosphere (or dimension), or the result of intensive gene-tailoring, possibly of the illegal sort. Regardless of their provenance, sentinel trees resemble thorny masses of knotted vines. Razor-sharp glass-like leaves flex like claws, and vibrating pods glisten, ready to detonate if thrown. If cultivated, they may take on a shape designed to further frighten---or at least warn away--- those who see one. Sentinel trees are mobile, aggressive, and feed on almost any sort of organic matter. Once it brings down prey, it sinks barbed roots in the body for feeding and decomposition.

**Motive:** Feed

**Environment:** In groves of three to six, able to tolerate most atmospheres (even thin ones, like on Mars) but not vacuum

**Health:** 12

**Damage Inflicted:** 3 points

**Armor:** 1

**Movement:** Immediate

**Combat:** Sentinel trees can fling a vibrating pod at a target within long range, which detonates on impact, inflicting 3 points of damage on all targets within immediate range of the blast. Targets must also succeed on a Might defense roll or be poisoned for 3 points of damage, plus 3 points again each subsequent round until a Might task is successful. A sentinel tree can also lash out with its barbed vines at a target within immediate range, inflicting 3 points of damage. Melee targets must also succeed on a Might defense roll or become entangled and unable to take physical actions until they can break free on their turn.

**Interaction:** Sentinel trees are about as smart as well-trained guard dogs. They can't speak, but can understand some words and gestures.

**Use:** A grove of sentinel trees guard a compound that the characters need to break into.

**GM Intrusion:** The character caught in the detonation is blinded with tiny black seeds until they use a recovery roll to remove the condition. (The recovery use doesn't return points to a Pool.)

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Silicon Parasite <---> 2 (6) {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

These tiny silvery insect-like creatures range in size from a sub-millimeter to up to 30 cm (1 foot) in diameter, emitting short pulses of violet-colored laser light to sense and sample their environment. Composed of organic silicon wires and wafers, and self-assembled or evolved in some unnamed lab or spacecraft wreck, silicon parasites are vermin that working space stations and spacecraft have learned to hate. Despite taking steps to avoid transfer, a ship may only learn they have silicon parasites when a swarm boils up from a crack in the cabling or seam in the deck plating after being agitated by a high-G maneuver or some other disturbance. If that disturbance is combat or some other dire emergency, silicon parasites thrown into the situation makes everything worse.

**Motive:** Defense, harvest electronic materials necessary to self-replicate.

**Environment:** Usually on spacecraft and space stations in groups of up to twenty

**Health:** 6

**Damage Inflicted:** 3 points

**Armor:** 1

**Movement:** Short; climbs a short distance each round

**Modifications:** Speed defense as level 4 due to size.

**Combat:** Only "large" silicon parasites are a danger to most creatures. When four or more parasites coordinate their attacks, treat the attack as that made by a single level 4 creature that inflicts 5 points of damage, and on a failed difficulty 4 Might defense roll, an attack that holds the target in place until it can successfully escape. A held target automatically takes 5 points of damage each round, or even more if other silicon parasites in the area pile on. Silicon parasites can operate in complete vacuum without harm.

**Interaction:** By and large, silicon parasites behave like social insects, though some claim that large numbers of them have acted with greater intelligence and forethought than mere unthinking insects can manage.

**Use:** A swarm of silicon parasites floods into the hold and makes off with an important device, dragging it into the crevices and walls of the spacecraft or station. Loot: Swarm nests often contain a few valuable manifest cyphers or working pieces of equipment.

**GM Intrusion:** The silicon parasite flashes its sensory laser directly into the character's eyes, blinding the character until they succeed on a difficulty 4 Might-based roll as their action.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Space Rat <---> 1 (3) {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Yeah, rats made it to space. And against all expectations, one strain evolved in the harsh radiation and zero-G environments that would kill humans not protected by medical intervention. Space rats are furless, about two feet long, sport a truly prehensile tail, and can quickly change their shade of their skin to blend in to their surroundings. They can also drop into a state of extreme torpor that allows them to survive stints of vacuum exposure lasting several days.

Space rats are vermin, and any spacecraft or space station that hosts a nest must deal with constant issues from the rats burrowing into systems, stealing food and water, and causing systems to break down, even critical ones. They're also vicious when cornered.

**Motive:** Defense, reproduction

**Environment:** Anywhere humans live in space

**Health:** 5

**Damage Inflicted:** 3 points

**Movement:** Short; short when climbing or gliding through zero G

**Modifications:** Stealth and perception as level 5

**Combat:** Space rats flee combat unless cornered or one of their burrows is invaded. Then they attack in packs of three or more, and from an ambush if possible. One space rat pack attacks the victim as a level 3 creature inflicting 5 points of damage with claws, while another pack helps the first, or attempts to steal a food item or shiny object from the character being attacked. To resist theft while being attacked on two fronts, a target must succeed on a Speed defense roll hindered by two steps.

**Interaction:** Space rats are slightly more intelligent than their Earth-bound cousins, though true interaction is not possible. On the other hand, sometimes their behavior seems spookily sapient.

**Use:** Space rats assemble crude nests in out-of-the-way supply closets or in hard-to-reach system interiors, but often enough, end up shorting out weapons or life support. Sometimes, they get into the hold and eat anything edible in the cargo.

**Loot:** Some percent of valuable equipment stolen on the spacecraft or station finds its way to space rat nests.

**GM Intrusion:** Another rat unexpectedly pops out of panel on the wall or ceiling and screeches so loudly the PC must succeed on an Intellect defense roll hindered by two steps or be dazed until the end of their next turn from the surprise. Dazed creatures are hindered on all tasks.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Storm Marine <---> 4 (12) {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

The storm marine creed is an oft-repeated mantra, "I will never quit, knowing full well that I might die in service to the cause." Wearing advanced battlesuits, hyped up on a cocktail of experimental military drugs, and able to draw on a suite of cybernetic and network-connected drone guns, few things can stand before a storm marine fireteam. Storm marines usually work for nation-states, conglomerates, and similar entities. They mercilessly conduct their mission, even if that mission is to wipe out a rival. Storm marines that question their orders are quickly dispatched by their fellows.

**Motive:** Achieve mission goals

**Environment:** Alone in or in fireteams of three, anywhere nation-states or similar entities have a financial or military interest

**Health:** 15

**Damage Inflicted:** 6 points

**Armor:** 4

**Movement:** Long; flies a long distance each round

**Modifications:** Perception as level 6; attacks as level 5 due to combat targeting neuro-wetware.

**Combat:** Thanks to their battlesuit, a storm marine has many options in combat. They can deploy an electrified blade to attack every foe in immediate range as a single action, or use a long-range heavy energy rifle that inflicts 6 points of damage.

A storm marine can deploy two level 3 gun drones that fire energy rays at two different targets up to 800 m (2,600 feet) away, inflicting 6 points of damage. If the drones focus on a single target, a successful hit deals 9 points of damage and moves the target one step down the damage track. The drones can attack only once or twice before returning to their cradles in the storm marine's suit for several rounds to recharge.

**Interaction:** A storm marine might negotiate, but getting one to act against their mission is difficult.

**Use:** A fireteam of storm marines are sent to eliminate the PCs or someone the PCs know on suspicion of being radical elements that need to be dealt with.

**Loot:** Though bio-locked to each storm marine, someone who succeeds on a difficulty 8 Intellect task to reprogram the suit could gain a battlesuit of their own, minus the drones (which fly off or detonate).

**GM Intrusion:** A character targeting a gun drone rather than the storm marine hits the drone, but the drone reacts by darting to the character and exploding, inflicting 6 points of damage to the character and anyone standing within immediate range.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Shining One <---> 5 (15) {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Some alien beings abandoned their physical forms millennia ago, becoming entities of free-floating energy and pure consciousness. They travel the galaxies, exploring the endless permutations of matter, space-time, cosmic phenomena, dark energy, and life. They are endlessly fascinated with the permutations they discover. They sometimes appear as a silhouette of gently glowing light, in a form like to the alien species they wish to observe. Under circumstances where a shining one is moved to more directly interact, one can actually convert itself into matter once more, again taking on the biology and form of the species it wishes to interact with. But generally, shining ones observe and learn; they try not to interfere or interact. Every few thousand years, shining ones gather at a predetermined location on the edge of a convenient galaxy and share the most interesting and beautiful bits of imagery, music, poetry, and lore they've gleaned.

**Motive:** Knowledge

**Environment:** Anywhere, usually alone

**Health:** 15

**Damage Inflicted:** 6 points

**Movement:** Instantly moves to anywhere it can see at the speed of light as part of its action once per round

**Modifications:** All tasks related to knowledge as level 8

**Combat:** As immaterial beings of energy, shining ones only take damage from energy attacks. And even then, there is a chance that the energy heals a damaged shining one rather than harming it if the attack roll was an odd number. Usually a shining one doesn't fight back if attacked, but instead leaves. If somehow prevented from leaving, a shining one fights for its existence with energy blasts inflicting 6 points of damage on up to two different targets within very long range (or the same target twice).

Alternatively, a shining one may attempt to discorporate a target, turning it into a being something like itself. In this case, each time a target is hit by an energy blast, it must also succeed on an Intellect defense roll. On a failed roll, it loses 6 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor). If the target's Intellect Pool is emptied, it becomes a freefloating ball of energy unable to take any actions other than observe for a few minutes before suddenly converting back to its original form with an explosive pop.

**Interaction:** Shining ones can manipulate their environment to communicate with other species, using sound, light, puffs of odiferous complex chemicals in place of words, and so on. If approached with respect, they freely exchange information with others, seeking to grow their knowledge and that of those they meet.

**Use:** A shining one is sharing knowledge to a warlike xenophobic species that could allow them to rapidly advance their ability to consolidate power. Something must be done before it's too late.

**GM Intrusion:** A character hit by the shining one's energy blast catches on fire. They take 3 points of damage each round until they spend an action patting, rolling, or smothering the flames.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Supernal <---> 5 (15) {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Half humanoid and half-dragonfly, supernals are beautiful entities, though certainly alien. Each supernal possesses a unique wing pattern and coloration and, to some extent, body shape. These patterns and colors may signify where in the hierarchy a particular supernal stands among its kind, but for those who do not speak the language of supernals (which is telepathic), the complexity of their social structure is overwhelming. Whether they are agents of some unknown alien civilization or seek their own aims, supernals are mysterious and cryptic. Most fear contact with them, because they have a penchant for stealing away other life forms, who are rarely seen again.

**Motive:** Capture humans and similar life forms, and bring them somewhere unknown.

**Environment:** Almost anywhere

**Health:** 23

**Damage Inflicted:** 6 points

**Movement:** Short; flies a long distance (even through airless vacuum); can teleport to any known location once per ten hours as an action

**Modifications:** All knowledge tasks as level 6; stealth tasks as level 7 while invisible

**Combat:** Supernals usually only enter combat when they wish, because they bide their time in a phased, invisible state. But when one attacks with the touch of its wing, it draws the life force directly out of the target, inflicting 6 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor).

A supernal can summon a swarm of tiny machines that resemble regular dragonflies made of golden metal. The swarm either serves as a fashion accessory as they crawl over the supernal's body, or as components in a piece of living art.

Supernals regain 1 point of health per round (even in an airless vacuum, which they can survive without issue), unless they've been damaged with psychic attacks. They can teleport to any location they know as an action once every ten hours.

Supernals often carry manifest cyphers useful in combat, as well as an artifact.

**Dragonfly swarm:** level 2; flies a long distance each round; eases physical tasks, including attacks or defense

**Interaction:** Although supernals only speak telepathically, peaceful interaction with these creatures is not impossible. It's just very difficult, as they see most other creatures as something to be collected and taken to some undisclosed location, for unknown reasons.

**Use:** A character is followed by a supernal intent on collecting them. Loot: A supernal usually has a few manifest cyphers, and possibly an artifact.

**GM Intrusion:** The supernal grabs the character and flies up and away, unless and until the character escapes the grab.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Synthetic Person <---> 5 (15) {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Synthetic people have been called many things, including simply synths, androids, robot mimics, and, depending on how they act, killer robots. Their origins are varied. In some cases, they're the result of corporate research into "products" that would serve humanity as assistants and companions, but later gained sentience. In other cases, synthetic people are the result of a state-sponsored program to develop war machines or automated assassins that looked like regular people. Another origin for synthetic people is through the design of awakened (and inimical) AIs as part of an effort to kill off all regular biological people. Now they roam their environment looking like anyone else. Some synths try to fit into whatever kind of society they can find. Some may not even know that they are not human. Others are bitter, homicidal, or still retain their programming to kill. Some of these may have even shed some or all of their synthetic skins to reveal the alloyed mechanisms beneath.

**Motive:** Varies

**Environment:** Nearly anywhere, out in plain sight or disguised as a human alone, or in gangs of three to four

**Health:** 24

**Damage Inflicted:** 7 points

**Armor:** 2

**Movement:** Long

**Modifications:** Disguise and one knowledge task as level 6

**Combat:** A punch from a synthetic person can break bones. In addition, some synths (especially of the killer variety) can generate a red-hot plasma sphere once every other round and throw it at a target within long range. The target and all other creatures within immediate range of the target must succeed on a Speed defense task or take 7 points of damage.

A synth can take a repair action and regain 10 points of health. A synthetic person at 0 health can't repair itself thusly, but unless the creature is completely dismembered, one may spontaneously reanimate 1d10 hours later with 4 points of health.

**Interaction:** Synthetic people that pretend to be (or think that they are) human interact like normal people. But an enraged one or one that's been programmed to kill is unreasoning and fights to the end.

**Use:** A group of refugees who need help turn out to include (or be entirely made up of) synthetic people. Whether or not any of them harbor programs that require that they kill humans is entirely up to the GM.

**Loot:** One or two manifest cyphers could be salvaged from a synth's inactive form.

**GM Intrusion:** The character is blinded for one or two rounds after being struck by the synth's searing plasma ball.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Thundering Behemoth <---> 7 (21) {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

When life is found on other worlds, it's sometimes large and dangerous, such as the aptly named thundering behemoth. A thundering behemoth might be found on any number of alien planets that feature forests and/or swamps. Towering to treelike heights, these fearless predators are powerful and dangerous hunters, even for those armed with advanced or fantastic weaponry. Behemoths use color-changing frills to help them appear like tall trees while they stand in wait for prey, as still as mighty hardwood trunks, until they break cover and spring an ambush. Behemoths can produce extraordinarily loud noises, sometimes simply roaring, but often replicating the stuttering scream of an attacking spacecraft. They use their strange "roars" to confuse, lead astray, and, if possible, stampede prey into killing grounds such as regions of soft sand, off cliff tops, or as often as not, into the waiting mouth of another behemoth.

In the sci-fi setting of Numenera, similar creatures are called rumbling dasipelts.

**Motive:** Fresh meat

**Environment:** Forests, alone or in a hunting group (known as a "crash") of two or three

**Health:** 35

**Damage Inflicted:** 9 points

**Armor:** 2

**Movement:** Short

**Modifications:** Disguise (as trees) as level 8 when unmoving. Deception (sounding as if an attacking spacecraft) as level 8. Speed defense as level 3 due to size.

**Combat:** A thundering behemoth can attack a group of creatures (within an immediate area of each other) with a single massive bite. Thanks to its long neck, it can make that attack up to 9 m (30 feet) away. One victim must further succeed on a Might defense task or be caught in the creature's maw, taking 9 additional points of damage each round until it can escape.

A thundering behemoth's ability to replicate threatening noises is often used deceptively at a distance, but the creature can use it to stun all targets within immediate range so they lose their next turn on a failed Might defense roll.

**Interaction:** Behemoths have a complex communication system among themselves, using their color-changing frills and modulation of the thunder they produce. They think of humans and most other creatures as food.

**Use:** The sound of fighting spacecraft has repeatedly spooked human colonists on an alien planet, though they have rarely seen destructive beams or actual spacecraft. Worried that that will soon change, the residents ask the PCs to investigate.

**GM Intrusion:** The character avoids being bitten but is batted away by the behemoth'sattack, tumbling a short distance (and taking 5 points of damage).

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Vacuum Fungus <---> 5 (15) {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Vacuum fungus is sometimes found as a greenish ooze on the exterior of spacecraft or space stations, growing in fine lines through the ice of frozen moons, and infesting the center of small asteroids and near-Earth objects (NEOs). Though able to survive in vacuum, the fungus takes on new morphology when sufficient spores find their way into habitable zero-G spaces. Then they fuse together and grow into a bulbous, emerald-hued fruiting body, typically reaching about 1 m (3 feet) in rough diameter, though individuals can grow much larger if not discovered. Sticky and soft to the touch, they are able to grow undetected in the dark corners of cargo holds, in ductworks, hanging from the ceiling of unused crew quarters, and so on.

Vacuum fungus may be proof that extra-terrestrial life exists, but that triumph of scientific discovery may seem less important to those who find a clump, because they are incredibly toxic to living creatures.

**Motive:** Reproduction

**Environment:** Anywhere in zero G, as an unreactive ooze in vacuum, or as a fruiting body in atmosphere, alone or in a cluster of three to five

**Health:** 22

**Damage Inflicted:** 6 points

**Movement:** Climbs (adheres) an immediate distance each round

**Combat:** A fruiting body can selectively detonate spore pods along its surface once per round. When a pod detonates, green fluid sprays everywhere within immediate range. Living creatures who fail a Speed defense roll take 6 points of damage from the clinging fluid. An affected target must also succeed on a Might defense roll. On a failure, an affected section of flesh rapidly swells, becoming a bilious green lump, and explodes one round later, having the same effect as a detonating pod.

**Interaction:** No real interaction with vacuum fungus is possible.

**Use:** Scientists are incredibly excited to discover that the strange ooze they've noticed staining the exterior of their research domes is actually a variety of fungal life. They will likely become less excited when they discover the large growths secretly growing in the cavity beneath the floor of their research dome in a little-used storage closet.

**GM Intrusion:** Striking the vacuum fungus clump causes one of the spore pods to detonate immediately, even though it's out of turn.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Wharn Interceptor <---> 8 (24) {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Wharn interceptors are void-adapted behemoths, several hundred meters in length. It's hypothesized that they are living battle automatons devised by ancient ultras, though against what long-vanished enemy isn't clear. Now, a handful (hopefully no more) glide through the depths of space like dormant seeds, seeming for all the galaxy like some strangely whorled asteroid or planetesimal. Who knows how many millennia they passed in this apparently hibernating state? But when that hibernation ends, maybe because some ancient countdown is nearing its end, or because an asteroid miner tried to extract a sample, they open eyes burning with deadly energy, and flex claws of particle-beam fury.

Wharn interceptors may be related in some fashion omworwars, so much so that humans sometimes call the latter "wharn cogitators." However, it's impossible that omworwars simply "appropriate" any wharn interceptors they encounter.

**Motive:** Defense

**Environment:** Anywhere floating through the void

**Health:** 53

**Damage Inflicted:** 15 points

**Armor:** 5

**Movement:** Flies a very long distance each round; can maneuver like an autonomous level 5 spacecraft if using extended vehicular combat rules. FTL capable.

**Modification:** Speed defense as level 3 due to size.

**Combat:** Most of the time, wharns are inactive and might look like tumbling rocks. In this state, space voyagers may be able to partly wake one in an attempt to negotiate. However, if a wharn is damaged, or if the passive senses deep in its body wake it for reasons of its own, it becomes aggressive.

A wharn's main weapons are its claws, which can extend in an instant, becoming exotic-matter beams able to reach a target up to a light-second away. Unless a target is protected by some kind of force field, the 15 points of damage inflicted ignores Armor. A wharn's eyes can pierce most forms of camouflage, cloaking effects, and cover that is less than about 200 m (650 feet) thick.

**Interaction:** In spite of their ferocious aspect and war-machine heritage, wharn interceptors do not destroy every spacecraft (and void-adapted creature) they come across, or even most. Indeed, sometimes a wharn may attempt to initiate communication via various machine channels. But what comes across are usually nonsense sounds and tones, and sometimes mathematical formulas.

**Use:** The PCs, attempting to enter an abandoned space station or spacecraft, are distracted when a wharn attempts to destroy the very same object.

**GM Intrusion:** The wharn moves unexpectedly, striking the vehicle the PCs are traveling in, inflicting 8 points of damage to everyone on board.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Wraith <---> 4 (12) {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Wraiths (Homo vacuus) are genetically engineered to live in the vacuum of space by directly metabolizing high-energy charged particles abundant in the void. Though derived from human stock, wraiths are alien in body, sometimes concealing themselves in layers of shroud-like tissue, other times revealing themselves as wispy, elongated things of glowing red plasma. In some settings, wraiths are partners with humans, working in locations where humans would find difficult. In other settings, wraiths went their own way generations earlier, and rediscovering them would be a first contact scenario. Alternatively, wraiths might be a threat to humans, hating humans for having created a species forced to spend its existence in the dark void of space.

**Motive:** Varies with individual or setting

**Environment:** Anywhere in vacuum, though usually with access to some kind of enriched radiation source. Environments with 1 G or higher eventually kill wraiths.

**Health:** 15

**Damage Inflicted:** 6 points

**Movement:** Short when flying in zero and low G

**Modifications:** Perception and stealth tasks as level 7

**Combat:** Wraiths can unfold from their concealing shrouds and attack with radioactive limbs for 6 points of Speed damage from ionizing radiation (ignores most Armor), or if available, technological weapons. Some can direct ionizing radiation as long-distance attacks, though doing so costs the wraith 1 point of health. Wraiths are immune to radiation, and attacks using radiation heal a wraith's lost health by the amount of damage the attack would have otherwise afflicted. Gravity of 1 G or greater hinders all wraith actions.

**Interaction:** Wraiths communicate by radio. They react to outsiders as dictated by their place in the setting.

**Use:** A distant space station stops all communication. Investigators are dispatched to find out what happened. Once aboard, they unravel clues that suggest wraiths may have been responsible.

**Loot:** Some wraiths carry valuable items and equipment.

**GM Intrusion:** The attacked character must also succeed on a Might defense, or they take an additional 3 points of ambient damage and contract radiation sickness.

{{< hint danger >}} {{< columns2 >}} Zero-Point Phantom <---> 3 (9) {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Temporary violations of conservation of energy mean that "virtual particles" constantly and seemingly randomly pop out of nothing, briefly interact with normal matter, then disappear. Zero-point phantoms are collections of such particles, taking the form of a very large, almost spider-like entity of many legs, stalks, and arms. What they're doing when they're not manifest is unknown; are they entombed in nearby solids, phased into another dimension, or do they simply not exist until they are called into being by some random cosmic event? Whatever the case, zero-point phantoms seem to prefer unlit or dimly lit areas in spacecraft and stations far from any planet, when they seem to struggle out of solid surfaces, raising a cloud of shadow.

**Motive:** Hungers for flesh

**Environment:** Anywhere dark

**Health:** 15

**Damage Inflicted:** 4 points

**Movement:** Short; short when climbing

**Modifications:** Speed defense as level 4 due to a cloud of shadows surrounding a zero-point phantom

**Combat:** A zero-point phantom attacks with needlelike leg and tentacle tips. A victim that takes damage must succeed on a Might defense task, or become poisoned, the effect of which is to drop them one step on the damage track. The victim must keep fighting off the poison until they succeed or drop three steps on the damage track; however, those who fall to the third step on the damage track from a phantom's poison are not dead. They are paralyzed and can't move for about a minute. If a phantom isn't otherwise occupied, it can grab a paralyzed victim and phase back into non-existence. Most victims phased away in this fashion are never seen again.

Zero-point phantoms can stutter in and out of existence on their turn once every few minutes. When they do, they return with full health.

**Interaction:** Zero-point phantoms are about as intelligent as predators like wolves.

**Use:** The abandoned spacecraft is weirdly empty of any bodies whatsoever. It's as if everyone just disappeared. There are signs of a struggle, though with what isn't clear,

GM (group) Intrusion: Nearby light sources fail. Attacks and defenses against the zero- point phantoms are hindered by two steps for characters unable to see in the dark.

## Additional Science Fiction Equipment

In a science fiction setting, the following items (and anything else appropriate to the setting) are usually available.

**Equipment:** Equipment includes apparel, armor, cybernetic implants, personal drone assistants, and other items that, for the most part, can be easily transported. Technically speaking, armaments are also equipment. Unless it's important to make a distinction, assume all guidance regarding "equipment" also applies to armaments. But when it is important to make a distinction, the term "armaments" is used for equipment that is also a weapon.

**Armaments:** From contemporary bullet-firing pistols to fantastically advanced handheld disintegration guns, the weapons presented in this chapter are dedicated to those that a single character can carry and use.

## Variable Cost By Tech Rating

Equipment costs assume the setting is predominantly of same tech rating as the object's tech rating. The price drops by one price category if the setting tech rating is, generally speaking, greater than the object's tech rating.

Note, however, that inexpensive items do not become free; they remain inexpensive.

## Weapon Options Granted By Type Or Focus

When a player makes up their character, their type likely indicates that they can choose one or more weapons of their choice. When choosing such weapons and equipment, the following restrictions apply to that choice:

* Characters must choose weapons within, or less than, the average tech rating of the setting.
* Characters may not choose weapons in the exorbitant or priceless price category.

## Contemporary Styling In Advanced Or Fantastic Settings

Equipment listed as contemporary can often be had in hard science fiction or fantastic genres, possibly at a lower price. Note that such equipment available in these future worlds are not necessarily antiques (though they could be), but rather cheaply made objects.

## Equipment Power

For the most part, assume that equipment is either self-powered, or easily powered by charging fields or other ubiquitous and freely available sources. That is, unless a piece of equipment losing power makes a good GM intrusion in a clutch situation.

## Customizing Equipment

Listing all possible armaments and equipment and their many variants across all three tech ratings, at least in the space available, isn't an option. However, a representative cross section is provided. If you're looking for something that isn't noted, look for something close and adapt the listing

## Equipment Listing

### Communication

#### Lightspeed Communication Delays

For ease of reference, the light delay table provides the time it takes light from the sun to each planet in our solar system, plus a few other notable locations. To figure light delays between two different locations, subtract the time delay of the object closer to the sun from the time delay of the object farther away. The difference is the light delay between those two locations. Double times for two-way communication

#### Light Delay Table

| Location          | AU   | Light Delay |
| ----------------- | ---- | ----------- |
| Mercury           | 0.4  | 3 minutes   |

#### Advanced

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Communicator, badge/ring <---> level 3 (9) <---> Moderate {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As satellite phone, but so small it can be worn as a stylish insignia or badge on a cuff, chest, pendant, or carried in a pocket; as a ring worn on a finger, earlobe, or other pierced appropriate or pierced body part; or threaded into a tattoo on wrist or back of hand. Has full voice functionality, including on-the-fly translation (for languages in a network-connected database), and audibly duplicates most smartphone functions.

A communicator badge in the form of ring is often referred to as a data-ring.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} AR glasses <---> level 4 (12) <---> Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Sturdy (and sometimes stylish) eyeglasses or goggles provides all the functions of a contemporary smartphone (including communication) and communicator badge, plus is capable of both immersive VR and overlaid HUD and augmented reality functions. Can be worn inside a space suit helmet or incorporated directly into one.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} AR contacts <---> level 4 (12) <---> Expensive x2 {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As AR glasses, but are lenses fitted to the eye. Also called "smartacs."

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Courier <---> level 5 (15) <---> Exorbitant {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Essentially a tiny rocket that can exceed human-rated Gs to "quickly" deliver messages across planetary distances if radio (via DSM network), laser, or even graser communication is deemed too susceptible to interception by a third party. A courier must be launched in a micro-gravity environment.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Laser array <---> level 5 (15) <---> Exorbitant {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

A bulky piece of equipment that takes a few days to set up and calibrate. Useful for ship-to-ship communication for "tight" beaming information; even highly focused lasers spread out to several miles after only traveling a few light-seconds, diminishing their usefulness. Also doubles as a spacecraft weapon system (but all attack tasks using it are hindered).

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Graser array <---> level 5 (15) <---> Exorbitant {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As laser array, but collimates gamma rays, which diverge far less quickly than light, allowing communication between planets. Also doubles as a spacecraft weapon system (but all attack tasks using it are hindered).

#### Fantasic

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Mind's eye <---> level 4 (12) <---> Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As contemporary AR glasses, but directly incorporated into the brain as cortical implant. Incorporation grants eidetic memory, the ability to link senses between authorized users within network range, and some control over brain chemistry, granting an asset on all tasks the user attempts to control or moderate their own reactions.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Ansible <---> level 6 (18) <---> Exorbitant {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

A bulky piece of equipment that takes a few days to set up and calibrate, and which requires enormous power per use, allows instantaneous communication between two points even across interstellar distances.

### Sense-Enhancing Tools

Some communication devices also provide sense-enhancing abilities, such as the smartphone, AR glasses and contacts, and the mind's eye implant.

#### Contemporary

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Binoculars <---> level 2 (6) <---> Moderate {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Provides an asset for perception tasks at range.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Camera, surveillance <---> level 3 (9) <---> Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Wireless transmission to internet node, radio within long range, or flash storage to be picked up physically at a later date; includes microphone and ability to have conversation through camera speakers.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Microscope <---> level 3 (9) <---> Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Provides an asset to any research task where small-scale perception could provide additional information, though analysis requires several hours or more.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Nightvision goggles <---> level 3 (9) <---> Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Reasonably accurate vision in complete darkness, up to 100 m (330 feet).

Any one of a number of pieces of lab equipment that takes a few days to set up and calibrate, including chromatography columns2, mass spectrometers, calorimetry analyzers, and more. Such a piece of equipment grants two assets to any analysis task where perception could provide additional information, though analysis requires several hours or more.

#### Advanced

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Hand scanner <---> level 4 (12) <---> Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Smartphone-like device customized for analysis; provides an asset for identifying tasks.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} White noise generator <---> level 5 (15) <---> Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Fist-sized device that fuzzes frequencies all across the spectrum, hindering all electronic perception and surveillance tasks within short range by five steps.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Lab-on-a-chip <---> level 5 (15) <---> Very Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Portable 15 cm (6 inch) cube with many inputs and readouts (and network connections). Eases any research task where small-scale perception could provide additional information by two steps, though analysis requires about ten minutes.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Research drone <---> level 4 (12) <---> Very Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Autonomous frames about 1 m (3 feet) in rough diameter fitted with all manner of surveillance devices, including visual, audio, chemical, and lab-on-a-chip functionality. Propelled by rotors in an atmosphere or micro-thrusters in vacuum. Research drones can also be controlled through AR glasses or smartphones to any distance communications reach.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Tactile drone <---> level 4 (12) <---> Very Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As research drone, except without the suite of analysis tools, providing only audible and visual feeds back to controller (if there is one), but with physical options; tactile drones can accomplish routine tasks and attempt those of level 4 or less, or allow a remote operator to attempt more difficult tasks at a distance.

#### Fantasic

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Multicorder <---> level 5 (15) <---> Very Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Handheld device provides two assets and one free level of Effort to any perception, analysis, or computing task that the device's multiple sensors (including radio, gravimetric, chemical, visual, audio, and others) within short range. Analysis requires only one round to complete.

An ability granting a free level of Effort usually must be unlocked by the application of at least one level of Effort, in effect providing one more level of Effort than what was paid for

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Probe drone <---> level 6 (18) <---> Exorbitant {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

More advanced version of a contemporary research drone that can be deployed to other planets and even star systems to gather environmental and tactical information, which is transmitted back. If forced to defend itself, this level 6 robot has Armor 3 and two long-range energy blasts each round that inflict 8 points of damage each.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Sonic toolgrip <---> level 6 (18) <---> Exorbitant {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Handheld toolgrip manifests a sonic effector field that serves as a multifunctional tool in a wide variety of circumstances. Suitable for picking a lock, unscrewing a bolt, analyzing the interior of an object, as a microphone, for tracking movement, hacking electronics, charging electronics, or even tuned to a high-intensity beam that can blind nearby targets for a round. The sonic toolgrip eases all tasks by two steps.

### Apparel & Armor

Unless the GM is running some kind of survival-related scenario, characters can be presumed to have basic clothing and footwear suitable to their environment.

#### Contemporary

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Cold weather gear <---> level 3 (9) <---> Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Insulated clothing, including gloves, boots, and facemask, that allows wearer to function in extremely cold environments for several hours at temperatures down to –90 degrees C (–130 degrees F).

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Elegant clothes <---> level 3 (9) <---> Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Clothing suitable for moving in elite circles; provides an asset to interaction checks in some situations.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} SCUBA gear <---> level 4 (12) <---> Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Self-contained underwater breathing apparatus allows wearer to function underwater for about an hour at depths (under normal Earth atmosphere) of up to 40 m (130 feet)

#### Contemporary Armor

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Leather jacket <---> level 2 (6) <---> Moderate  {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Functions as light armor (+1 Armor).

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Kevlar vest <---> level 3 (9) <---> Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Functions as medium armor (+2 Armor).

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Military body armor, light <---> level 4 (12) <---> Very Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Functions as medium armor (+2 Armor), encumbers as light armor.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Military body armor <---> level 4 (12) <---> Very Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Functions as heavy armor (+3 Armor).

Remember, armor (lowercase a) is something you wear. Armor (capital A) is the bonus you get. You can have only one type of armor at a time, but you can have many sources of Armor, theoretically.

#### Advanced

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Safesuit, space <---> level 2 (6) <---> Moderate {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Cheap, mass-produced one-size-fits-all vacuum-protection "suit" (sometimes they look more like a bag) of thin polymer suitable for emergency decompression events but not for long-term use. Can be put on and sealed with one action, but any physical action taken while wearing one is subject to automatic GM intrusions on a d20 die roll of 1 or 2. If a roll triggers a GM intrusion, the suit tears.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Breather <---> level 2 (6) <---> Moderate/Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

A facemask providing a day of breathable air in poisonous or low-oxy atmospheres, or continuously for expensive breathers with recycling and oxy extraction features. If used in a vacuum, a breather provides the wearer three rounds of action before the full effects of vacuum begin dropping them on the damage track.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Exoskin, grav-assist <---> level 3 (9) <---> Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Powered anthropomorphic exoskeleton allows completely normal function in high gravity environments of up to 5 G. Exoskins are related to loader mechs. Increase the cost category by one to grant +1 Armor.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Shipboots <---> level 3 (9) <---> Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Any footwear that allows variable magnetic adhesion to a surface; cancels the hindrance to all physical actions suffered by those acting in zero-gravity conditions.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Pressure suit <---> level 3 (9) <---> Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

A full-body suit similar to a space suit, but only rated for regions of low pressure (not vacuum) such as is typically found on Mars. Some come integrated with breathers (at double the cost).

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Exoskin, brute <---> level 4 (12) <---> Very Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As grav-assist exoskin, but high-tensile effectors ease all tasks related to Might.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Exoskin, reactive <---> level 4 (12) <---> Very Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As grav-assist exoskin, but integrated memory fibers ease all tasks related to Speed.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Space suit <---> level 4 (12) <---> Very Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Protects a wearer from vacuum and allows basic normal activities in space. Requires about four rounds to put on and seal (going quicker risks a bad seal). Provides about ten hours of atmo in a vacuum without refurbishment. Extremely limited maneuvering thrusters provide a couple of opportunities to correct a poorly aimed jump through zero G. Shipboots are usually built in.

"Atmo" is the catch-all term for oxygenated, breathable air and livable pressure.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Stealthsuit <---> level 4 (12) <---> Very Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Provides two assets to stealth tasks.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Swimsuit, hydrodynamic <---> level 4 (12) <---> Very Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Next-generation materials repel water, increase oxygen consumption, and shape swimmer's body to better swimming ideal; provides two free levels of Effort to swimming tasks.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Space suit, deluxe <---> level 5 (15) <---> Very Expensive x2 {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As space suit, but deluxe and durable. A deluxe suit features built-in recyclers granting air, water, and nutrition for about a week of continuous use. Microthrusters allow for continuous zero-G maneuvering over a period of ten minutes, or even more if air reserves are tapped (which depletes them). If the suit is breached because of external damage, self-sealing tech limits repercussions described in Taking Damage in a Space Suit to just a round or two, assuming the breach is not catastrophically large.

### Taking Damage In A Space Suit

Taking damage while protected from the effects of vacuum in a space suit (or safesuit) requires one additional defense roll. On a failure, the suit breaches and begins to spew precious air, heat, and pressure into the void. Deluxe space suits have auto-sealing functionality, repairing the puncture within a round. But during any round a suit is leaking, all tasks are hindered as the spray of venting atmosphere jerks or even spins the character around. Those with less advanced suits must find some way to seal the breach within three rounds, otherwise on the fourth round, they are treated as if in vacuum.

#### Advanced Armor

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Battlesuit, deluxe <---> level 6 (18) <---> Exorbitant {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As battlesuit, but with armor and power assist; the battlesuit grants an additional +1 to Armor in addition to the 3 Armor that heavy armor usually offers, and encumbers as medium armor. Armor rating also applies to damage that often isn't reduced by typical armor, such as heat or cold damage (but not Intellect damage).

#### Fantasic

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Breather, vacuum <---> level 3 (9) <---> Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Facemask generates a variable forcefield around wearer that provides comfortable temperature and atmo to wearer in poisonous atmospheres, underwater, or in vacuum, for several hours, even without a space suit.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Bounding boots <---> level 4 (12) <---> Very Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Gravity-assist boots provide two free levels for Effort for jumping and running tasks. In addition, wearer can fall from any height safely if prepared for the descent.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Cloak, chameleon <---> level 5 (15) <---> Very Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Renders wearer essentially invisible save for hardly-noticeable distortions for up to ten minutes. Provides one asset and one free level of Effort to stealth tasks.

An ability granting a free level of Effort usually must be unlocked by the application of at least one level of Effort, in effect providing one more level of Effort than what was paid for.

#### Fantasic Armor

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Force field, quick <---> level 4 (12) <---> Very Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Not armor; belt generates an almost transparent force field to surround the user for up to one hour, providing +1 Armor. Once used, must be recharged for several hours.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Cloak, impact <---> level 5 (15) <---> Very Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Fashionable cloak with attached hood. If the wearer is subjected to a physical or energy attack, the garment strategically hardens, functioning as heavy armor (+3 Armor), and encumbering as light armor.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Cloak, reflective <---> level 6 (18) <---> Very Expensive x2  {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As chameleon cloak, but also reflects energy attacks back on attacker if PC succeeds on their defense task.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Battle armor <---> level 6 (18) <---> Exorbitant {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Force field, omni <---> level 6 (18) <---> Exorbitant {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As quick force field, but permanent while active, requires no recharge period. In addition, the wearer can tune the field so that it's hazed and translucent, hiding their identity, or make it fully dark so that it emits no light (though they can see through the field normally).

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Kinetic ring <---> level 6 (18) <---> Exorbitant {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Ring reactively projects a powerful energy field to deflect or slow projectiles, easing the wearer's Speed defense roll. If the projectile still hits the wearer, the field grants +1 to Armor against the attack.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Gun armor <---> level 6 (18) <---> Exorbitant x2 {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As battle armor, but armor includes a deployable integrated long-range plasma weapon that inflicts 6 points of damage. It's able to fire autonomously, allowing the wearer to take some other action (though if set to do so, automatic GM intrusions occur on 1–3 on a d20, and if triggered, result in friendly fire).

Requires special feedstock, which is an expensive cost to replace after every dozen or so uses, though items printed by the 4D printer can be recycled, extending the feedstock supply accordingly. Many long-haul spacecraft seek to obtain a 4D printer because having one significantly reduces the amount of material that must otherwise be carried.

#### Fantasic

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Carryall pack <---> level 5 (15) <---> Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As backpack, but dimensional folding allows for an arbitrary number of objects to be stored inside, so long as they fit the carryall pack's 60 cm (2 foot) diameter mouth.

### Health Care And Nutrition

Health care is too broad a topic to cover in depth. However, for purposes of on-the-go amelioration of wounds and other injuries, the following options are available. In particular, advanced tech autodocs include any number of partly robotic healing kits or automated hospital devices.

#### Contemporary

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Trail rations (1 day) <---> level 1 (3) <---> Inexpensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Serum, remedial <---> level 3 (9) <---> Moderate {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

"Serum" is an often-used term for an ampule of artificially engineered blood and plasma that provides some kind of benefit. Serums of all types are generally dispensed from an autodoc, but may also be obtained as individual units, or in packs or cases. An ampule of remedial serum grants the user 3 points they can add to any Pool. It also has the benefit of relieving hangover symptoms.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Serum, space-fit <---> level 4 (12) <---> Moderate {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As remedial serum, but protects against the two most common dangers to human physiology from extended trips into space and long-term exposure to zero G and radiation, which most notably include DNA breakage from cosmic rays and bone and muscle deterioration from microgravity. An ampule of space-fit serum lasts for about a month.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Serum, acceleration <---> level 4 (12) <---> Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As remedial serum, but allows user to ignore the many deleterious physiological effects of acceleration and high-G maneuvers (of up to 15 Gs) for one hour (or of up to 20 Gs for a few minutes). Users are likely unable to move under high G, but won't pass out, have a stroke, cardiac arrest, etc.---at least, not immediately. Prolonged use may still lead to all these outcomes.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Serum, antivenom <---> level 4 (12) <---> Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As remedial serum, but grants a Might task eased by four steps to withstand and clear poison from the user's system and provides similar poison resistance for one day.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Transplant, organ or limb <---> level 4 (12) <---> Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

If an autodoc or more advanced facility is available, a lost limb or organ can be replaced. Replaced limbs eventually become equally effective as the original, with practice. However, the mechanical (or possibly force-grown) prosthetic limbs initially hinders all physical tasks attempted using it for several weeks.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Autodoc, mobile <---> level 4 (12) <---> Very Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Pack-sized kit that eases any healing task, or up to four free recovery rolls. Also usually has a variety of serum types. (Each use requires a depletion roll of 1 on a d10; if depleted, autodoc supplies are used up, and it must be refilled as an expensive cost.)

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Hibernation pod <---> level 4 (12) <---> Very Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

A pod large enough to contain a human, with internal mechanisms and power able to safely put a person into a deep state of arrested metabolism for about a hundred years, unless the program ends sooner or the pod is opened from the exterior. Each hundred years thereafter, the hibernating human must succeed on a Might defense task. The difficulty begins at 1, but increases by +1 every few hundred years that pass.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Omnichair <---> level 4 (12) <---> Very Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Provides user full mobility via combination of micro thrusters, retractable wheels, and maglev levitation in all environments (from microgravity to full gravity), often contains a variety of tools and enhancements that grant the user assets to common tasks (possibly including a built-in weapon system). If customized to do so for an additional very expensive cost, can extend a fairing, enabling the omnichair to act as a sort of space suit/miniature spacecraft at need.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Autodoc <---> level 5 (15) <---> Exorbitant {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As mobile autodoc, but fixed in place (suitable for a starcraft or station sickbay), and grants essentially unlimited recovery rolls or serum injections to anyone who spends at least an hour immobilized on the autodoc med table, even for the most minor of treatments.

#### Fantasic

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Nano tab, general <---> level 4 (12) <---> Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Any of a variety of pill-like concentrations of nano-scale robots designed to activate once taken by mouth.

#### Advanced

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Auton <---> level 1 (3) <---> Moderate {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

The generic term "auton" refers to a smart robot, one able to exist in the world as a full-fledged entity, though not nearly so competent as a true AI. On the other hand, autons come very close to having self-awareness, and some have probably achieved it. The variety of autons is staggering, given that they can be trained in nearly any task. Autons also come in a variety of shapes and colors, which vary based on culture and tech level. Though most can move on treads or legs to follow their owners as directed, some autons are housed in drone-like chassis using either rotors or microthrusters, allowing them to fly rather than move on the ground. Treat a basic auton as a level 1 follower, which allows the auton modifications in one task.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Auton, aide <---> level 2 (6) <---> Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Treat as a level 2 follower, which allows the auton modifications in up to two tasks, depending on the particular aide.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Auton, medical <---> level 2 (6) <---> Exorbitant {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As auton, but one modification is always healing. A medical auton also incorporates a mobile autodoc.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Auton, defense <---> level 2 (6) <---> Exorbitant {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As auton, but one modification is always Speed defense, which means when helping to defend a target from a physical attack, the target eases the task by two steps. A defense auton also has 3 Armor.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Auton, military drone <---> level 2 (6) <---> Exorbitant {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As defense auton or warrior auton, but miniaturized and able to fly in gravity to support owner.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Auton, warrior <---> level 2 (6) <---> Exorbitant {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As auton, but one modification is always in attacks, which means when helping a target to make an attack, the target eases the task by two steps. However, warrior autons usually attack autonomously as level 3 entities with a ranged or melee weapon that inflicts 5 points of damage.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Shipmind <---> level 3 (9) <---> Exorbitant x2 {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

A shipmind is a sim AI that exists within a single spacecraft or starship, with the ability to control many aspects of vehicle functions as necessary to supplement a crew, or sometimes in lieu of a crew. Shipminds each have their own simulated personality, emulating consciousness, though in most cases, they are not actually conscious. Having a shipmind installed on a spacecraft is immensely helpful, as it can oversee many basic functions. A shipmind usually accomplishes tasks at the level of the ship in which it is installed.

#### Fantasic

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Synth <---> level 3 (9) <---> Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Synths are a blend of biological and mechanical parts so advanced that in some cases it's impossible to tell the difference between a living creature and a synth. They are strong AIs in physical bodies. Other varieties of synths are constructed (or have modified themselves) to make it obvious they are not biological. In any case, synths are often sturdier and longer lasting than an average biological entity. Even so, in some settings, synths are relegated to being servitors, as if they were simple robots and autons. In other settings, a few, some, or all humans have long ago migrated into synth bodies, leaving their biology behind in prehistory, and becoming posthuman. Treat as a level 3 follower, which allows the synths modifications in up to three tasks, depending on the particular synth. At minimum, all synths have 2 Armor and regain 1 point of lost health per round if damaged.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Synth, companion <---> level 4 (12) <---> Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As synth, but treat as a level 4 follower, which allows the synths modifications in up to four tasks.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Synth, free <---> level 5 (15) <---> Expensive\* {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As companion synth, but with modifications for up to five tasks. \*A free synth usually can't be purchased, by definition, but can be hired on a contract basis, as an expensive cost for each week of service required.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Wardroid <---> level 6 (18) <---> Exorbitant {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As free synth, but outfitted for war, including modifications in attack and defense. A wardroid often has many additional customizations and abilities.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Synth, infiltrator <---> level 7 (21) <---> Priceless {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As free synth, but with modifications focusing on stealth, disguise, and tasks related to gaining entry to guarded locations for purposes of spying or assassination. Synth infiltrators have systems that allow them to change their apparent (or even actual) shape completely over the course of a minute to appear as another creature or innocuous object.

### Recreation

Occasional recreation is absolutely necessary to maintain stable relationships as well as mental stability and happiness. Characters that never engage in recreation become gradually more unhappy and troubled, and eventually find interaction tasks and most Intellect tasks hindered unexpectedly.

#### Contemporary

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Book <---> level 2 (6) <---> Inexpensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Print, digital, or audio; once perused for at least ten minutes, grants an asset to relaxation tasks.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Card/tabletop/digital game <---> level 2 (6) <---> Inexpensive/Moderate {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Suitable for passing the time and building bonds between friends and strangers alike.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Alcohol/drugs <---> level 2 (6) <---> Inexpensive/Moderate/Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Common intoxicants taken in moderation can raise spirits, easing tasks related to social interaction while at the same time hindering tasks related to perception and physical coordination. Excessive amounts cancel out the benefit to social interaction and hinder all tasks by two or more steps, making even routine tasks a challenge. Extended excessive use can lead to addiction, a long-term disease difficult to recover from.

Other kinds of drugs have a different ease and hinder profile. For example, the dose of caffeine in a cup of coffee can ease tasks related to concentration and motivation but hinder tasks related to resisting anxiety and irritability. On the other hand, addiction to caffeine normally isn't nearly as serious an addiction as alcohol or opioids.

#### Advanced

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Sidekick sphere <---> level 2 (6) <---> Moderate {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Circuit-inscribed, and jauntily decorated, smart-material sphere about 1 m (3 feet) in diameter that rolls or jumps to stay within an immediate distance of owner. Capable of playing music, pulsing with light, engaging in witty conversation, and in keeping confidence. Treat the sidekick sphere as a level 2 follower (and limited sim AI).

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Tattoo, programmable <---> level 3 (9) <---> Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

With time and talent, someone with a programmable tattoo implant can completely alter the designs that appear on their skin, modifying lines and color. A small alteration requires only a few rounds, but a full-body tattoo change, assuming any artistry at all is involved, may take a few days to complete.

#### Fantasic

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Tattoo, living <---> level 3 (9) <---> Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As programmable tattoo, but images can be animated to run in a loop, or visually respond with limited reactivity to certain audible or other cues. Some come implanted with sim AIs for conversation and interaction.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Pleasure bit <---> level 4 (12) <---> Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Handheld device emits magnetic induction field that activates the reward circuit in the user's brain, creating sudden ecstasy and joy for a pre-set period of time. Addiction is possible, though better models have an ebbing mode that helps put users back into their right minds gradually.

## Armaments Listing

A selection of weapons for your sci-fi setting rated by level, price, function, and tech level

### Armament Ammunition & Charge

Weapons require ammunition ("ammo"), whether that's rounds of a particular caliber, energy packs, or something even more exotic. You can handle ammo requirements for weapons in one of three ways: exact tracking, abstracted monthly upkeep cost, or not worrying about it.

Exact tracking means asking the character to track their available and used rounds/shots after (and possibly during) a fight.

Abstracted monthly upkeep cost assumes that the characters go through ammo at an average rate, and obtaining more ammo or energy packs is something they do in their "off-camera" time. The monthly upkeep cost for ammo should equal about two steps less in price category than the weapon in question.

Or you can just not worry about keeping track of ammunition, especially in games where gunplay isn't common.

#### Contemporary

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Ammo (box of 50 rounds) <---> level 1 (3) <---> Inexpensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Caliber varies by specific firearm, used in most contemporary ranged weapons

#### Advanced/Fantastic

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Energy pack (50 shots) <---> level 1 (3) <---> Inexpensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Watt-hours (Wh) varies by specific energy weapon, used in most advanced and fantastic ranged weapons.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Smart rounds (box of 4 rounds) <---> level 4 (12) <---> Very Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

A smart round can be used to make one normal attack plus up to 3 additional ricochet attacks on targets within short range of the attacker and each other as one action. Each ricochet attack successively increases the GM intrusion range by 2. If a GM intrusion is triggered, the ricochet attack hits something other than what the attacker intended, such as an important system or ally.

A character who uses a smart round on a group of foes could attempt to attack up to 4 of them with one shot; however, the GM intrusion range on the last ricochet attack would be 1–7 on the d20.

### Melee Weapons

Any weapon that a character must use by swinging or stabbing at a target within immediate range is considered a melee weapon. Most contemporary melee weapons rely on the strength of the wielder.

#### Contemporary

Produces a 1 m (3 foot) blade of sun-hot plasma that cuts through any material of up to level 7. Can be wielded as either a medium weapon in one hand or as a heavy weapon in two hands (4 damage or 6 damage). It ignores 3 points of a target's Armor (except from force fields).

### Ranged Weapons

Any weapon that fires a projectile or other destructive force at a target within short or longer range is considered a ranged weapon.

#### Contemporary

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Bow <---> level 2 (6) <---> Moderate {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Vacuum handgun, heavy <---> level 3 (9) <---> Very Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As contemporary handgun, but uses special rounds designed to fire in a zero-oxygen environment, and that are self-propelling so firing this gun in zero or low gravity doesn't spin wielder backward.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Vacuum rifle, assault <---> level 3 (9) <---> Very Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As contemporary assault rifle, but uses special rounds designed to fire in a zero-oxygen environment, and that are self-propelling so firing this assault rifle in zero or law gravity doesn't spin wielder backward.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Foam restraint rifle <---> level 4 (12) <---> Very Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Thick rifle emits a short-range stream of orange liquid that foams over a target and hardens into a body restraint that lasts for ten minutes. A restrained victim can't move or take actions that require movement. A target whose level is higher than the rifle's level can usually break free within one or two rounds.

This rapid-fire weapon can operate in conjunction with Spray or Arc Spray abilities. It ignores 2 points of Armor value (except from force fields).

### Blaster Weapons

**Optional Blaster Rule as the Default:** The advantage that blaster weapons have over other projectile and coherent light weapons is their ability to penetrate targets, which renders Armor less effective. This optional rule is presented as the default rule in [The Stars Are Fire](https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/the-stars-are-fire/) to demonstrate their superior tech level even over advanced tech weapons.

## Equipment And Weapons As Artifacts

Cypher System artifacts in a science fiction setting could potentially be any one of the items presented in this chapter, if found by characters in a less advanced setting than its tech rating. That said, even in advanced or fantastic settings, opportunities to find especially unusual devices are everywhere.

### Equipment

-----

#### Dimensional Modulator

**Level:** 1d6 + 3

**Form:** Marble-sized crisscross shape of unknown material

**Effect:** A target within immediate range loses their dimension of breadth (which folds into a higher dimension), rendering them as flat as paper. The target adheres to whatever surface it was attached to, set upon, or was standing upon, and resembles particularly realistic art. An affected creature enters stasis. While in stasis, it is unable to take actions, doesn't age, and is immune to damage and effects. It remains in stasis for about a day, until the user returns the missing dimension or the artifact depletes.

**Depletion:** 1 in 1d10

-----

#### Metabolic Prod

**Level:** 1d6 + 1

**Form:** 1 m (4 foot) metallic rod of unknown material

**Effect:** When touched to a living target (possibly as an attack), the rod injects a potent cocktail of engineered biomolecules, paralyzing the target for up to one minute. The rod wielder may also choose one of the following additional effects, if set before attacking.

**Aggression:** The target's aggressive tendencies are increased for one hour, during which time the target attacks almost anything it encounters.

**Calm:** The target's aggressive tendencies are tamped down for one hour, during which time the target responds to attacks but never initiates them.

**Hibernation:** The target falls into hibernation, a coma-like sleep in which their metabolism slows to a crawl. They can go months with no additional food or water and with a fraction of the air they'd normally need. Loud sounds, damage, persistent prodding, and the like wakes someone in hibernation.

**Depletion:** 1 in 1d20

Probability Regulator

**Level:** 1d6 + 4

**Form:** Fist-sized mathematically perfect solid of constant width of unknown material

**Effect:** For tasks that are usually random, the user exerts some level of control. When picking a card, rolling a die, choosing a number, or otherwise taking an action that skill usually plays no part in, they attempt an Intellect task whose difficulty is determined by how unlikely choosing correctly might be, so long as it is possible, even if unlikely. A 50/50 coin flip is a difficulty of 1, whereas picking a series of numbers with odds around 1 in 300,000,000 is difficulty 10. If successful, they achieve the desired result.

**Depletion:** 1 × task difficulty in 1d20

-----

#### Steorraform

**Level:** 1d6 + 3

**Form:** Badge-sized seven-pointed star of unknown material

**Effect:** If the wearer would become debilitated or die, the worn steorraform prevents it by instantly restoring health (to a creature or an NPC) or points to a Pool (to a player character). If the wearer would die of old age, disease, or poison, the artifact prevents it by rolling back the clock by a few decades, clearing the disease, or denaturing the poison. The artifact is ineffective in preventing death when those conditions last over several rounds or more, such as falling into lava, the sun, a singularity, and so on.

**Depletion:** 1 × number of previous uses in 1d20

### Weapons

Artifacts that can be used as weapons, though some have other uses as well.

**Light, Medium, and Heavy Artifact Weapons:** The artifact weapons described in this section are idiosyncratic in that they are not described as light, medium, or heavy. If they were specifically categorized, many characters would find that their training doesn't match up with a particular designation. With artifact weapons living outside the regular weapon categories, anyone can use an artifact weapon.

-----

#### Alpha Beam Projector

**Level:** 1d6 + 3

**Form:** Rifle-like device of unknown material

**Effect:** The device has two settings. One fires a beam of energy that acts as propulsion and rockets the artifact away unless the user can hold onto it as a difficulty 1 Might-based task. A user could use this setting to fly a long distance each round, but doing so requires a difficulty 4 Speed-based task each round to move in the direction desired (and not plow into the ground or the side of a building). The other setting fires a reactionless beam that can be used as a very long-range plasma attack that inflicts damage equal to the artifact level. The beam ignores 1 point of Armor from the target.

**Depletion:** 1 in 1d20

-----

#### Carbonizer

**Level:** 1d6 + 3

**Form:** Pistol-like device of unknown material

**Effect:** This device fires a beam that transmutes the matter of targets within short range into powdery ash, inflicting damage equal to the artifact level that ignores Armor from force fields and natural scales, leather, and other organic sources.

**Depletion:** 1 in 1d20

-----

#### Death Ray

**Level:** 1d6 + 3

**Form:** Pistol-like device of unknown material

**Effect:** This device fires a beam that transmutes the matter of targets within short range into powdery ash, inflicting damage equal to the artifact level that ignores Armor from force fields and natural scales, leather, and other organic sources.

**Depletion:** 1 in 1d20

-----

#### Disintegration Beamer

**Level:** 1d6 + 2

**Form:** Rifle-like device with two electrodelike protrusions of unknown material

**Effect:** This device fires a beam to suppress the charge of the electrons that make up a creature or object within long range, inflicting damage equal to twice the artifact's level. If the attack reduces the target's health (or combined Pools for a PC) to below the level of the artifact, the target instantly falls to dust. (A PC who would be disintegrated can spend 1 XP and instead descend one step on the damage track.)

**Depletion:** 1 in 1d20

-----

#### Empathetic Ray

**Level:** 1d6 + 2

**Form:** Rod-like device with very long barrel of unknown material

**Effect:** This device emits an invisible beam of neural-magnetic energy as a short-range attack that instantly reverses how a level 1 target sees the user (turning an enemy into a friend, and vice versa) for up to one day. The user can adjust the settings to increase the ray's effectiveness by making one additional depletion roll per increase in the maximum level of the target. Thus, to alter the attitude of level 5 target (4 levels above the normal limit), the user must make five depletion rolls. If used against a PC, an affected PC can attempt an Intellect task to end the effect once every minute for the first few minutes, then once every hour.

**Depletion:** 1 in 1d20

### Science Fiction Artifacts

Artifacts in a science fiction game can be strange relics from an unknown alien source or tech items that aren't yet widely available. In a galactic setting, for example, it's easy to imagine that innovations or specialized items might not have spread everywhere.

-----

#### Amber Casement

**Level:** 1d6 + 4

**Form:** Series of short, rounded tubes and hoses about 12 inches (30 cm) long

**Effect:** The device solidifies the air in a 10-foot (3 m) cube of space, the center of which must be within short range. The air is turned into an amberlike substance, and those trapped in it will likely suffocate or starve.

**Depletion:** 1–4 in 1d6

-----

#### Metabolism Bud

**Level:** 1d6

**Form:** Organic pod, almost like a small, hemispherical bit of brain; once grafted to a host, the host's flesh grows over the pod until it is only a lump

**Effect:** The pod grafts onto any living host (usually near the brain or spine) and injects chemicals that boost the creature's metabolism. This permanently raises the host's Speed Pool maximum by 5 points.

**Depletion:** ---

-----

#### Mind Imager

**Level:** 1d6 + 2

**Form:** Handheld device with a plastic panel screen and wires that must be affixed to the head of a creature

**Effect:** This device shows a visual image of what a creature is thinking. The affected creature need not be conscious.

**Depletion:** 1 in 1d20

-----

#### Psychic Crystal

**Level:** 1d6 + 4

**Form:** Violet crystal the size of a fist

**Effect:** The crystal allows the user to transmit their thoughts telepathically at an interstellar distance. Even at that range, communication is instantaneous. Each use allows about a minute's worth of communication, and the communication is entirely one way (so having two crystals would be handy).

**Depletion:** 1 in 1d10

-----

#### Repair Sphere

**Level:** 1d6 + 2

**Form:** Small spherical automaton about 8 inches (20 cm) in diameter

**Effect:** This device comes with a small module that can be affixed to a machine. Floating along, the sphere attempts to follow within immediate range of the module (though it can be directed to remain where it is). It moves a short distance each round. It can come to the module from a range of up to 10 miles (16 km) away. If the module is attached to a machine and that machine takes damage, the sphere moves to repair the damage with sophisticated tools that restore 1d6 – 2 points per round (meaning that if a 1 or 2 is rolled, no damage is repaired that round). This requires no action on the part of the machine being repaired. The sphere can attempt to repair a machine a number of times per day equal to its level. The sphere must be newly activated each day.

**Depletion:** 1 in 1d100

## Vehicles & Spacecraft

**Vehicle:** Technically speaking, spacecraft are also vehicles. Unless it's important to make a distinction, assume all guidance here regarding "vehicles" also applies to spacecraft.

**Spacecraft (and Starship):* When it is important to make a distinction from a simple vehicle restricted to the land, sea, or air of a single planet, the term "spacecraft" is used for vehicles that travel beyond a single planet's atmosphere. Some spacecraft can operate both in space and as planetary vehicles, as noted in their entries. Additionally, a spacecraft that has FTL capability (as opposed to only interplanetary capability within a single solar system) is referred to as a starship.

### Variable Cost By Tech Rating

Vehicle costs assume the setting is predominantly of the same tech rating as the vehicle's tech rating. However, the price might drop by a price category if the setting tech rating is predominantly greater than the vehicle's rating.

### Contemporary Styling In Advanced Or Fantastic Settings

As previously indicated, vehicles listed as contemporary might be found in settings using advanced or fantastic tech, possibly at a lower price. However, the vehicles available in these future worlds are not (necessarily) antiques, but rather cheaply made objects, possibly with the veneer and stylings of vehicles suitable to the setting, and possibly the power source, too.

### Priceless Price Category

A priceless item is something that even the very rich can't afford, requiring the resources of a nation-state, or similar entity appropriate to the setting, to acquire or build.

### Fighting In A Vehicle

If PCs are involved in combat in which they are only partly or lightly enclosed (or not at all enclosed, as in the case of most cycles, boards, and similar conveyances), use normal rules of combat, as modified by vehicular movement. However, if PCs are involved in a combat where they are completely enclosed in a vehicle with no possibility of openness to the environment through which they can fire weapons (so that it's not really the characters fighting, but the vehicles), use the vehicular combat rules from the CSR.

If PCs are involved in space combat, see the extended vehicular combat rules described in this book, which provide all kinds of additional options.

### Driverless Vehicles

If the rider, driver, or pilot activates self-driving as part of another action, riding, driving, and piloting tasks are automatically completed (or failed) according to the vehicle's level, though all such self-driving tasks are hindered. However, the pilot is free to engage in other actions as the vehicle maneuvers to the best of its ability.

This driverless function is also available on many spacecraft, courtesy of a shipmind, which is a sim AI that can control the ship's functions as necessary. Shipminds control spacecraft at the spacecraft's level, not their level, but are not subject to the task hindrance that more basic driverless vehicles suffer.

### Looking For More Vehicle Options

A representative cross section of vehicles is provided. If you're looking for something that isn't noted, use something close and adapt the listing.

Also note that unless a particular listing is already indicated as a luxury or sport version, most vehicles can be obtained in a luxury or sports package, either at the next price category up, or at double the indicated price.

### Customizing Vehicles

Assuming the facilities are available, characters can pay for the customization of their vehicle to add a weapon system, add even more weapon systems, add superior weapon systems, or some other significant option. In most cases, the cost for such an upgrade is very expensive to exorbitant.

Can run and fly up to a very long distance each round, and can even ascend into low orbit for brief periods.

## Spacecraft Listing

Most spacecraft have the capacity to reach orbit from the surface of the planet, if not radically more advanced capabilities. All spacecraft completely enclose their crew in a sealed cabin (or series of chambers) with life support suitable for days, weeks, or much longer. Most spacecraft also come with one or more spare space suits, tools, a few spare parts, and so on. Advanced and fantastic spacecraft also have sensors that provide enough astronavigation information to plot and fly to their destinations.

PCs in spacecraft can travel to other moons, planets, space stations, and perhaps even other solar systems. PCs in spacecraft may also get caught up in space combat (see the Extended Vehicular Combat rules) and run across space hazards.

### Spacecraft Upkeep

Each month of spacecraft operation usually requires that the PCs pay for fuel, feedstocks, and other upkeep. The level of the spacecraft determines upkeep.

| Level | Upkeep Cost    |
| ----- | -------------- |
| 1-2   | Moderate       |
| 3-5   | Expensive      |
| 6-7   | Very expensive |

### Retrofitting Power And Drives

Older spacecraft and starships are often retrofitted with more advanced power sources, and more importantly, FTL drives, in order to give them the ability to move further. The main reason to do this is that such ships cost much less, especially if retrofitted advanced ships are available in a fantastic setting, but even for craft within the same tech rating. During vehicular combat, retrofitted ships are treated as if 1 level lower than their actual level for purposes of level comparison in combat if they are fighting FTL-capable fantastic-rated starships.

#### Contemporary Power

**Solar Panels:** Usually flat panels that convert sunlight to electricity, which can be used for a variety of onboard systems, including powering ion drives.

**RTGs:** When solar panels are not an option, as is often the case for spacecraft that operate far from the sun or on a planetary surface with lots of dust or shadow, RTGs (radioisotope thermoelectric generators) are good long-term power sources for electric power, which can be used for a variety of onboard systems, including powering ion drives. The heart of an RTG is an embedded mass of atomic isotope, such as plutonium-238.

#### Contemporary Drives

**Rocket:** A rocket engine produces thrust by expelling reaction mass, usually in thundering expanding white clouds from the rocket's base propulsion nozzle. Most contemporary spacecraft use a mix of several rockets and fuel types. Rockets are the primary constituent of a heavy-lift launch spacecraft.

**Ion Thruster:** Ion thrusters can use solar panels or RTGs (or both) to expel ions (or cations) to produce thrust over long periods, which allows a spacecraft to build up speed over large periods of time. The bleeding edge of contemporary ion thruster is VASIMR (Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket), which could drastically reduce travel times around the solar system, if perfected.

#### Advanced
<!-- TODO: empty section? -->

#### Advanced Power

**Fusion Power:** Electrical generation by using heat from nuclear fusion reactions, requiring relatively small fuel input for much higher-power output. Fuel sources include helium-3 (abundant on the Moon and other locations in the solar system without an atmosphere).

#### Advanced Drives

**Nuclear Plasma:** Essentially, nuclear plasma drives are just very advanced ion thrusters, the promised "perfected" version. These are great, unless the setting has fusion drives, in which case nuclear plasma drives may seem quaint.

**Fusion Drive:** Relying on fusion power, a fusion drive is an order of magnitude more efficient than a contemporary ion thruster. A fusion drive does not require the creation of electricity to ionize propellent, but instead directly uses the fusion product as an exhaust to provide thrust.

#### Fantasic

#### Fantastic Power

**Antimatter Power:** Antimatter particles have opposite charge from their matter counterparts, giving them potentially explosive properties when combined, producing energy an order of magnitude more than a fusion power system. Fuel sources include both antimatter as well as Li2 (an atom with 2 lithium ions), important for controlled matter-antimatter reaction so it can be harnessed for power.

**Singularity Power:** Taps energy from Hawking radiation and rotational energy of a spinning micro-black hole to generate energy an order of magnitude more than nuclear power. Fuel source is a micro-black hole.

**Zero-Point Generator:** Vacuum energy is created by normal fluctuation in the quantum field of normal space-time. This zero-point radiation of the vacuum provides arbitrary (possibly limitless) amounts of energy with no fuel other than the initial resources required to build the generator.

#### Fantastic Drives

**Warp Drive:** A warp drive uses enormous power to distort the fabric of space-time to create a bubble surrounding the starship. The bubble moves by compressing space-time in front of it and expanding space-time behind it, moving independently of the rest of the universe to achieve apparent FTL travel. Warp drives can achieve objective speeds of up to 500 times the speed of light at maximum power.

**Hyperdrive:** Similar to warp drive in some ways, but pushes the ship into a different realm of existence, often called hyperspace, where laws of physics differ significantly and many more dimensions are accessible, allowing a ship to greatly surpass the speed of light before returning to normal space. Hyperdrives can achieve objective speeds of up to 1000 times the speed of light at maximum power.

**Wormhole Drive:** A wormhole drive uses enormous power to open a shortcut between two locations in space-time and travel between those points in a matter of seconds. Most wormhole drives rely on regions of space where wormholes can be formed, or on previously established networks of wormhole tunnels that the wormhole drive accesses. Which means that while travel between two points might be almost instantaneous, travel to and from wormhole-viable locations could greatly increase travel times. Likewise, wormholes can normally only bridge locations up to 200 or so light-years at a time (which means it would take about 500 jumps to cross the Milky Way galaxy from end to end).

**Dark Drive:** A dark drive (short for "dark matter quantum drive") uses enormous power to enable point-to-point transitions between other locations in the galaxy (or universe) using previously unrealized entanglement between normal matter and dark matter. However, objective travel time is variable and somewhat arbitrary; sometimes a trip may take minutes, other times days or months. For those aboard, relative travel time seems constant at about four solar hours, no matter the distance traveled, or the objective time noted by external observers.

### Pioneer-Era Spacecraft

Though extremely complex, pioneer-era spacecraft are not robust vehicles. Technology allowing re-use of components is still in its infancy in these contemporary tech spacecraft, and small problems have a way of becoming major catastrophes if not caught and quickly dealt with. In fact, that very complexity exacts a toll.

Generally speaking, all tasks for operating a pioneer-era spacecraft are hindered by two steps. Only the very well trained (or the very lucky) should even consider trying to operate such a craft. Finally, pioneer-era spacecraft usually don't have weapon systems.

#### Contemporary

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Space Capsule <---> level 1 (3) <---> Priceless {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Sealed capsule delivered into space by a launch vehicle or shuttle, carries a crew of up to seven or a payload of up to 6,000 kg (13,000 pounds); once delivered into a microgravity environment, becomes a free-flying spacecraft with limited maneuverability, though all piloting tasks are hindered and propellant must be renewed every ten hours of use. Capable of safely returning crew and cargo back down a gravity well though a fiery reentry process that lands the capsule in water for recovery by watercraft.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Rocket, heavy-lift launch <---> level 2 (6) <---> Priceless {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Provides access to low orbit and beyond for a cargo of up to 45,350 kg (100,000 pounds) through the coordinated efforts of dozens of engineers and controllers operating and monitoring the vehicle from another location. Extremely limited maneuverability; a detachable space capsule allows for transfer of crew or cargo to orbiting craft or stations from the launch vehicle after ascent. Craft is partially re-usable in that the booster rockets autonomously return to designated pads where they can be refurbished and refueled.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Shuttle, launch <---> level 3 (9) <---> Priceless {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As heavy-lift launch vehicle, except the main craft can re-enter an atmosphere after delivering a payload and land aerodynamically as a fixed wing craft. Much greater maneuverability than a launch vehicle, both in space and in the air on re-entry, though all piloting tasks are hindered. Refurbishment means essentially rebuilding the spacecraft, and is a process of many months and another priceless expenditure in cost.

#### Torpedos In Space Combat

Once launched, self-guiding torpedoes engage smart-tracking systems to zero in on their assigned targets. The torpedo accelerates at 50 or more Gs towards its target, but at the extended distances in which many space battles occur, it may still take several rounds for a torpedo to finally home in on and strike (or ultimately miss) its target.

### Spacecraft

Advanced spacecraft have advanced propulsion technologies, allowing them to move between planets within a single solar system, with transit times between planets varying from days to weeks (or more, if using a less efficient drive). Most advanced spacecraft can't land on a planet's surface unless noted, requiring some secondary craft or means to transfer crew and cargo.

#### Advanced

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Wafercraft, exploration <---> level 1 (3) <---> Very Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Miniaturized vehicle just large enough to contain thousands of tiny data flecks and sensor modules, designed to accelerate to 90% the speed of light by use of external launching laser beamed for many years. Data wafers contain encrypted personalities (human and/or AI) capable of gathering data on target solar systems after relative travel times of months (but decades in objective time).

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Microcapsule <---> level 2 (6) <---> Very Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As space capsule, but smaller. Limited fusion drive allows movement within a given area of space, but a microcapsule usually doesn't have enough fuel to move between planets. External manipulators allow the pilot to attempt repair and construction tasks without exiting the vehicle.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Microcapsule, fighter (dart) <---> level 1 (3) <---> Very Expensive x2 {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As microcapsule, but with a laser cannon weapon system capable of targeting another craft.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Spacecraft, racer <---> level 1 (3) <---> Exorbitant {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

A spacecraft designed only for speed and high-G maneuvers, with space for a single pilot (and maybe one passenger) in cradles fitted for high-G chemical amelioration, easing all piloting tasks by two steps. Travel times across limited interplanetary distances are halved in a racer. Mostly used for competition or as couriers.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Spacecraft, freighter <---> level 2 (6) <---> Exorbitant {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

A spacecraft designed to haul cargo between planets with a crew up of to 15. Freighter ships may be quite large, or at least haul cargo that is quite large, but these craft are bulky and not meant for quick changes in direction or combat; all maneuvering and combat tasks are hindered. Able to move interplanetary distances with advanced variable dynamic ion propulsion. Can land and take off from low-gravity moons and dwarf planets.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Spaceplane <---> level 2 (6) <---> Exorbitant {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As launch shuttle (contemporary), but fulfills the promise of launch (without boosters), operations and maneuverability in orbit, and reentry and landing on a planetary surface, all without need for massive refurbishment or colossal external network of controllers.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Spaceplane, combat (claw) <---> level 2 (6) <---> Exorbitant x2 {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As spaceplane, but smaller (with room for a single pilot), fitted with two weapon systems: a laser cannon and one torpedo battery. To move between planets or further, a claw usually relies on a larger carrier or more fantastic means of transport.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Spacecraft, solar sail <---> level 2 (6) <---> Exorbitant {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

A spacecraft designed for long-haul research expeditions around the solar system with a crew of up to five or six, with individual pods designed for induced hibernation during double or triple normal travel times to extend provisions to last several years or longer. No external power is required; solar power provides the motive force. Usually unable to land or ascend from a planetary surface.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Spacecraft, dragonfly class <---> level 3 (9) <---> Exorbitant x2 {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Has the planetary launch and reentry capabilities of a spaceplane, but is more expansive, able to house a live-in crew of about a dozen people and over 45,350 kg (100,000 pounds) of cargo, with interplanetary (as opposed to merely orbital) range. Life-support lasts three months before restocking supplies is required. The ship includes a bridge, crew quarters, engineering, an impressively large cargo bay, and a bay containing one microcapsule. May have one weapon system.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Spacecraft, exploration class <---> level 4 (12) <---> Exorbitant x3 {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As dragonfly class spacecraft, but larger and able to house a crew of about twenty-five people. Customized for exploration with extended range-sensing capabilities and onboard biological and geological labs (among others) for in situ analysis.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Spacecraft, corvette class <---> level 4 (12) <---> Priceless {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

A small warship spacecraft designed for high-G maneuvers, including use of high-G chemical amelioration for a crew of up to fifteen people. Features four weapon systems, including one laser cannon capable of targeting other craft, one torpedo battery, and one superior weapon system in the form of a gauss cannon. Able to move interplanetary distances with advanced variable dynamic ion propulsion. Can land and take off from lowgravity moons and dwarf planets.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Spacecraft, destroyer class <---> level 5 (15) <---> Priceless {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As corvette spacecraft, but four times as large, allowing four times the crew and ten weapon systems (including two superior weapon systems). Possesses superior defenses. Often utilized to escort larger vessels in a space fleet or battle group and defend them against swarms of smaller attackers. Includes bays for two fireteams of six microcapsule fighters (darts). 

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Spacecraft, dreadnought <---> level 5 (15) <---> Priceless {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As corvette spacecraft, but ten times as large, allowing ten times the crew and twenty weapon systems (including five superior weapon systems). Often utilized to escort larger vessels in a space fleet or battle group and defend them against swarms of smaller attackers. Includes bays for a squadron of fifteen darts and a fireteam of three combat spaceplanes.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Skyhook <---> level 6 (18) <---> Priceless {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Heavy rotating space station orbiting a moon or planet that extends two massive tethers opposite each other, so that one tether periodically dips deep into the atmosphere close to the surface. At this point, payloads are hooked to the end of the cable as the tether passes, and are then flung into orbit by the station's massive rotation. The skyhook can decelerate and safely de-orbit other payloads in the same way.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Space elevator <---> level 7 (21) <---> Priceless {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Tether anchored to the surface of a moon or planet that extends into space along which vehicles can travel, granting access to and from orbital space. A counterweight space station exists at the far end of the tether in what is essentially geostationary orbit.

### Starships

Starships are spacecraft that have FTL technology, allowing them to move between different stars, with transit times ranging from days to months, or years in extreme cases. Starships are also often capable of planetary landings and ascent with some retrofitting before each planetfall.

Starcraft (and other vehicles) of a higher tech rating involved in vehicular combat with craft of a lower tech rating are treated as if two levels higher when comparing relative levels for purposes of determining combat effectiveness.

#### Fantasic

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Dagger fighter <---> level 1 (3) <---> Very Expensive {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

A bare-bones, single-occupant fighter with a single weapon system that fires blasters. Dagger fighters cannot move between stars (though as fantastic craft, can move between planets), and require a larger carrier for FTL movement, such as a capital class starship with suitable docking bays.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Starship, cargo/passenger <---> level 2 (6) <---> Exorbitant {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

A spacecraft designed to haul cargo (or passengers, or both) between stars with a crew up of to twenty-five. Cargo starships may be impressively massive, or at least haul cargo sections that are quite large, but these craft are bulky and not meant for quick changes in direction or combat; all maneuvering and combat tasks are hindered.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Starship, solo fighter <---> level 2 (6) <---> Exorbitant {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

A small double-occupant starship with two weapon systems that fire blasters. Minimum size vehicle capable of FTL travel.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Starship, general purpose <---> level 3 (9) <---> Exorbitant {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

A small starship with room for only three to six crew plus an integrated ship AI able to handle many routine ship functions including navigation with FTL propulsion system. Designed for exploration of distant locations, salvage operations, and/or to act as a tug-craft for larger ships that need assistance. May possess a single weapon system such as a particle cannon.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Starship, discovery class <---> level 5 (15) <---> Priceless {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

A large research starship with quarters for crew and staff of up to 150 or more people. Has either centrifugal artificial gravity (or in a fantastic tech-rated setting, gravitic compensators providing shipboard gravity control). Primarily designed as a research and discovery vehicle, such starships also have three weapon systems, usually a couple of blaster cannons and a torpedo battery. Highly configurable, a discovery class ship could be converted for war with sufficient resources, granting it superior weapons.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Starship, warship class <---> level 5 (15) <---> Priceless {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

A relatively small warship with gravitic compensators allowing for extreme maneuvering for a crew of up to fifty people, easing all piloting tasks. Six weapon stations include three blaster cannons and three torpedo batteries. Two of these systems are superior weapons. Includes bays for a fireteam of three dagger fighter starships.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Starship, capital class <---> level 7 (21) <---> Priceless {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As warship class starship, but over a hundred times larger, with room for over a few hundred crew. Ten weapon stations include five blaster cannons and five torpedo batteries. Four of these are superior weapons. Includes bays for two squadrons of fifteen dagger fighter starships.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Starship, omega class <---> level 10 (30) <---> Priceless {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

Three times as large again as a capital class starship, an omega class craft has over a thousand crew and over thirty weapon systems. Ten of these are superior weapons. Combined weapon fire can deal significant damage to a planetary surface, possibly destroying it. Includes bays for six squadrons of thirty dagger fighter starships.

### Stellar Gate

Stellar gates open wormholes between two fixed points at different locations without crossing the space between. The complexity of building a stellar gate is so extreme that such technology is often ascribed to found portals and networks dating back to mysterious ancient ultras or by post-singularity AIs. As might be expected, gates have a fantastic tech rating, no matter how small.

#### Fantasic

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Gate, planetary <---> level 3 (9) <---> Priceless {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

A free-standing ring or horizontal circular pad up to 9 m (30 feet) in diameter in/over which a spherical event horizon forms, allowing one-way travel to another location on the planet, orbiting moon, or orbiting space station with similar gate structure. Once the event horizon collapses (after several minutes up to an hour), travel back to the original gate is possible by initiating a second event horizon, though power reserves usually take several hours or more to build up to support each new wormhole opening.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Gate, interplanetary <---> level 4 (12) <---> Priceless {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As planetary gate, but twice as large and connects gate structures that lie between locations within a single solar system.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Gate, star <---> level 5 (15) <---> Priceless {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As planetary gate, but four times as large and connects gate structures that lie between locations within a few thousand light-years.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Gate, galactic <---> level 6 (18) <---> Priceless {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As planetary gate, but six times as large and connects gate structures that lie between locations within a single galaxy.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Gate, intergalactic <---> level 7 (21) <---> Priceless {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As planetary gate, but six times as large and connects gate structures that lie between locations in different galaxies across the entire breadth of the universe.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Gate, interdimensional <---> level 7 (21) <---> Priceless {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As planetary gate, but connects gate structures that lie in alternate dimensions.

### Space-Time Vehicles

Space-time vehicles allow for movement between different points in both space and time. Such vehicles are vanishingly rare, and timelines in which they are active tend to eventually snuff themselves out due to accidental paradox events, limiting their availability even further. As with stellar gates, space-time vehicles are so complex that it's likely they are the product of ancient ultras or post-singularity AIs, and could be treated as artifacts with a depletion of 1 in 1d20.

#### Fantasic

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Car, temporal/dimensional <---> level 7 (21) <---> Priceless {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

As contemporary utility car or sports car, but once moving can transition into another preset dimension or time. Enormous power requirements require recharge period of several days between each use.

{{< hint debug >}} {{< columns2 >}} Matrix, temporal <---> level 8 (24) <---> Priceless {{< /columns2 >}} {{< /hint >}}

An arbitrarily shaped vehicle or structure, bigger on the inside than out, that allows a pilot to travel into different locations in time and space, though arbitrary destinations are sometimes achieved despite apparent navigation successes by the pilot. Enormous power requirements require recharge period of several days between each use.

## Vehicles As Artifacts

Cypher System artifacts in a science fiction setting could potentially be any one of the vehicles presented in this chapter, if found by characters in a less advanced setting than its tech rating. That said, even in advanced or fantastic settings, opportunities to find especially weird and hard-to-grok objects are everywhere.

A couple of examples of such artifacts are presented here.

-----

### Gate Ring

**Level:** 1d6 + 4

**Form:** Wearable ring of unknown material

**Effect:** Creates a full-sized shield that can be used as a regular shield in combat for one character, providing an asset on Speed defense rolls for the duration of that combat, after which it returns to its ring-like form. In addition, the wielder can command the deployed shield to become a functioning star gate that remains open for just one hour, leading to a strange destination (which the wielder is potentially aware of, if they ran sufficient analysis on the ring or otherwise gained information about it before using the function).

**Depletion:** Automatic (if gate is formed)

-----

### Fractal Traveler

**Level:** 1d6 + 4

**Form:** Goggle-like device of unknown material

**Effect:** When worn, induces a powerful hallucinogenic state in wearer. Hallucinations last for four hours, during which time the wearer seems to disappear from existence. From the wearer's perspective, they are falling through an ever-iterating fractal realm of mind-blowing imagery, possibly some version of hyperspace or dark energy network. At the end of that period they return to existence, either in the same location they left or somewhere they've previously visited. The images leave the viewer shaken, but for several hours all Intellect-based tasks are eased.

**Depletion:** 1 in 1d6

### Starships

Here are a few sample starship types:

| Starship    | Level             | Crew  | Weapon Systems |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ----- | -------------- |
| Fighter     | 1                 | 1     | 1              |
| Interceptor | 2                 | 1     | 1              |
| Freighter   | 3 (4 for defense) | 4     | 1              |
| Frigate     | 4                 | 20    | 4              |
| Cruiser     | 4                 | 25    | 5              |
| Battleship  | 10                | 1,000 | 36             |

"Crew" indicates the minimum number of people needed to operate the ship. Many ships can carry more passengers. "Weapon Systems" indicates the maximum number of different enemies the ship can target at once---but only one attack per target in any circumstance.

{{< hint info >}}
Since it's frighteningly easy to die in a space battle if your ship is destroyed, most ships have escape pods. Even fighter craft have ejection systems that put the pilot out into space in an environment suit. In other words, GMs should try to give PCs a way out of immediately dying if they get on the wrong end of a space battle.

### Effects Of Gravity

In a hard science fiction game, variable effects of gravity can't be waved away by tech that simulates normal gravity on spacecraft, space stations, and other worlds. Instead, it's an issue people must overcome.

**Short-Term Microgravity Exposure:** People new to low gravity might get space sickness. Newcomers must succeed on a difficulty 3 Might task or suffer mild nausea for about two to four days, during which time all their tasks are hindered. A few unlucky travelers (usually those who roll a 1 or otherwise face a GM intrusion) are almost completely incapacitated, and find all tasks hindered by three steps.

**Long-Term Microgravity Exposure:** Long-term exposure to microgravity environments without medical interventions degrades health. How long one spends in such conditions is directly relevant. The GM may assign long-term penalties to PCs if the situation warrants it, though the use of advanced space medicine, proper exercise, and recommended steroids and other hormones can avoid these complications.

**Low Gravity:** Weapons that rely on weight, such as all heavy weapons, inflict 2 fewer points of damage (dealing a minimum of 1 point). Short-range weapons can reach to long range, and long-range weapons can reach to very long range. Characters trained in low-gravity maneuvering ignore the damage penalty.

**High Gravity:** It's hard to make effective attacks when the pull of gravity is very strong. Attacks (and all physical actions) made in high gravity are hindered. Ranges in high gravity are reduced by one category (very-long-range weapons reach only to long range, long-range weapons reach only to short range, and
short-range weapons reach only to immediate range). Characters trained in high-gravity maneuvering ignore the change in difficulty but not the range decreases.

**Zero Gravity:** It's hard to maneuver in an environment without gravity. Attacks (and all physical actions) made in zero gravity are hindered. Short-range weapons can reach to long range, and long-range weapons can reach to very-long range.

### Effects Of Vacuum

Vacuum is lethal. There's no air to breathe, and the lack of pressure causes havoc on an organic body. An unprotected character moves one step down the damage track each round. However, at the point where they should die, they instead fall unconscious and remain so for about a minute. If they are rescued during that time, they can be revived. If not, they die.

### Traveling The Solar System

#### And Orbital Mechanics

In a hard science fiction setting, you might be interested in evoking the reality of travel times between colonies on planets and moons in the solar system. Even so, plotting a course between locations in the solar system isn't simple, because everything is always moving with respect to everything else. You could determine exactly how long a trip would take with some internet research. Or you could just evoke the effect of orbital mechanics and varying accelerations on interplanetary travel. Use the Interplanetary Travel Table to do so. For a trip between locations not directly compared, add up the destinations in between. The travel times assume a nuclear plasma engine of a kind already being tested today (but better), a steady thrust toward the destination, and an equally long and steady braking thrust over the last half of the trip before orbit insertion. Such propulsion systems can change velocity and sustain thrust for days at a time, which reduces bone loss, muscle atrophy, and other long-term effects of low gravity.

**Regardless, the travel times between distant locations bring home one thing:** space is big and lonely.

#### Interplanetary Travel

| Origin        | Destination           | Travel Time Using Nuclear Plasma Engine |
| ------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Earth/Moon    | Mars                  | 20 + 1d20 days                          |
| Mars          | Asteroid belt         | 30 + 1d20 days                          |
| Asteroid belt | Jupiter and its moons | 30 + 1d20 days                          |
| Jupiter       | Saturn and its moons  | 60 + 1d20 days                          |
| Saturn        | Uranus                | 90 + 1d20 days                          |

## Science Fiction Species Descriptors

In a science fiction setting, some GMs may want to offer alien species or androids, who are mechanically different from humans, as options for player characters. This can be accomplished by using descriptors. Two examples are below.

### Artificially Intelligent

You are a machine---not just a sentient machine, but a sapient one. Your awareness might make you an exception, or there may be many like you, depending on the setting.

Artificially intelligent characters have machine minds of one type or another. This can involve an advanced computer brain, but it could also be a liquid computer, a quantum computer, or a network of smart dust particles creating an ambient intelligence. You might even have been an organic creature whose mind was uploaded into a machine.

Your body, of course, is also a machine. Most people refer to you as a robot or an android, although you know neither term describes you very
well, as you are as free-willed and free-thinking
as they are.

You gain the following characteristics:

**Superintelligent:** +4 to your Intellect Pool.

**Artificial Body:** +3 to your Might Pool and your Speed Pool.

**Shell:** +1 to Armor.

**Limited Recovery:** Resting restores points only to your Intellect Pool, not to your Might Pool or your Speed Pool.

**Mechanics, Not Medicines:** Conventional healing methods, including the vast majority of restorative devices and medicines, do not restore points to any of your Pools. You can recover points to your Intellect Pool only by resting, and you can recover points to your Speed and Might Pools only through repair. The difficulty of the repair task is equal to the number of points of damage sustained, to a maximum of 10. Repairing your Might and Speed Pools are always two different tasks.

**Machine Vulnerabilities and Invulnerabilities:** Damaging effects and other threats that rely on an organic system---poison, disease, cell disruption, and so on---have no effect on you. Neither do beneficial drugs or other effects. Conversely, things that normally affect only inorganic or inanimate objects can affect you, as can effects that disrupt machines.

**Uncanny Valley:** You have a hard time relating to organic beings, and they don't react well to you. All positive interaction tasks with such beings are hindered by two steps.

### Quintar

You are a quintar from the planet Quint. You are basically humanoid but taller, thinner, and blue skinned. Your hands end in three very long fingers. Quintar have five genders, but all quintar prefer to be addressed as female when communicating with more binary species. Human emotions and sexuality fascinate them, but not because they don't have such concepts---quintar emotions and sexuality are just very different from those of humans. In general, quintar are more cerebral than other species, valuing knowledge over all else.

Quint is relatively Earthlike, with slightly less gravity but a slightly denser atmosphere.

You gain the following characteristics:

**Cerebral:** +4 to your Intellect Pool.

**Skill:** You are trained in one type of knowledge task of your choice.

**Skill:** Quintar fascination with human behavior eases all interaction rolls (pleasant or not) with humans.

**Difficult Rest:** Quintar subtract 2 from all recovery rolls (minimum 1).
