# Cypher System Reference Document

## Version: 2023-02-10

These rules of the Cypher System, taken from the Cypher System Reference Document (CSRD). The CSRD is provided by Monte Cook Games, as a free and legal way to access the rules and build upon them.

Use the navigation menu on the left to choose the section you'd like to read. They are ordered by the way they are ordered in the SRD, which follows the order of the full rulebook.

If end up loving the system, and want more content, or the full rulebook, I greatly encourage you to visit the [Monte Cook Games store](https://www.montecookgames.com/store/), and support the system.

## Support

If you would like to offer support, I encourage you to first try offering support through contributing to this endeavor. Be it frontend work (I am a DevOps/Backend dev), formatting, styling, etc. Even if we need to migrate to something other than Hugo (mkdocs, gatsby, whatever), open source contributions would be preferred.

If you wish to buy me a coffee or beer, feel free to use the option below.
