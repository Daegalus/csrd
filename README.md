# Cypher System Reference Document

The goal of this project is to make a nice, readable way to view the cypher system reference document.

The primary work is formatting and styling the text, with no changes in the words in the document.

## Goals

* Clean and Simple
* No changes to original wording.
* Markdown for readability and portability.

## Translations

There are no official translations to my knowledge, but if there ever are, this projects is prepared to handle it.

A new folder with the language code needs to be made, and a similar structure and set of files need to be created, but with the translated text.

As there are no official translations, I won't be accepting PRs with translations for the time being.

## Building locally

Dependencies:

* Git
* Hugo Extended Version (theme requires it)

When you pull the git repo, make sure you run `git submodule init` to pull the theme.

From tehre, you just need to run `hugo` to build, it will output to the `/public` folder, it will be created if it is nor present.

You can also use `hugo server --minify` to run a live-updating development server.
